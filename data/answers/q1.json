  "question": "According to Hurston in the opening paragraphs of the novel, how do men treat their dreams in contrast to women?",
  "answer": "According to Hurston, men passively watch their dreams from a distance, waiting for them to come in 'with the tide' like ships on the horizon. For some men, their dreams never arrive - they 'sail forever on the horizon' until the man gives up waiting and his 'dreams mocked to death by Time.' Men are portrayed as passive watchers who eventually resign themselves to unfulfilled dreams. In contrast, women actively engage with their dreams. Women 'forget all those things they don't want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to forget.' For women, 'The dream is the truth' - they embrace their dreams as reality and 'act and do things accordingly.' Women take action based on their dreams rather than waiting for them to arrive.",
  "quote": "Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. For some they come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is the life of men. Now, women forget all those things they don't want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to forget. The dream is the truth. Then they act and do things accordingly.",
