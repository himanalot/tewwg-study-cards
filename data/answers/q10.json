  "question": "In what kind of family was Janie raised?",
  "answer": "Janie was raised by her grandmother Nanny in the backyard of a white family named Washburn in West Florida. Janie never knew her parents - her father was absent and her mother left when Janie was very young. Nanny worked for the Washburns, who were 'quality white folks,' and had a small house in their backyard where Janie was born and raised. Janie grew up playing with the four white Washburn grandchildren and was treated so similarly to them that she didn't realize she was Black until age six when a photograph revealed her difference. Mrs. Washburn dressed Janie in the Washburn children's hand-me-down clothes and put ribbons in her hair. Eventually, after Janie was teased at school for living in the white folks' backyard, Nanny got her own land and house, with Mrs. Washburn helping considerably with the move.",
