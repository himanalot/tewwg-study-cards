  "question": "Why did Janie believe she was white?",
  "answer": "Janie believed she was white because she grew up on the Washburn property where her grandmother Nanny worked. She was raised alongside the Washburn grandchildren and played with them constantly from birth. Because she spent all her time with the white children and was treated the same as them by both Nanny and Mrs. Washburn, she had no awareness that she was racially different from them. She only discovered she was Black at around six years old when a traveling photographer took a group picture of all the children, and when she looked at it, she couldn't recognize herself as the dark-skinned child in the photo, asking 'where is me?' until Miss Nellie pointed out that she was the dark one, leading to her exclamation 'Aw, aw! Ah'm colored!'",

Wouldn't have found it out then, but a man come long takin' pictures and without askin' anybody, Shelby, dat was de oldest boy, he told him to take us. Round a week later de man brought de picture for Mis' Washburn to see and pay him which she did, then give us all a good lickin'. So when we looked at de picture and everybody got pointed out there wasn't nobody left except a real dark little girl with long hair standing by Eleanor. Dat's where Ah wuz s'posed to be, but Ah couldn't recognize dat dark chile as me. So Ah ast, 'where is me? Ah don't see me.'",
