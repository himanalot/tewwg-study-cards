  "question": "How did Janie learn for the first time in her life that she was not white?",
  "answer": "Janie learned she was not white when she was around six years old through a group photograph. A man came by the Washburn property taking pictures, and Shelby (the oldest white boy) told him to photograph all the children together. When the photograph came back about a week later, everyone was pointed out in the picture except for 'a real dark little girl with long hair standing by Eleanor.' Janie could not recognize herself as that dark child and asked 'where is me?' Miss Nellie pointed to the dark girl and said 'Dat's you, Alphabet, don't you know yo' ownself?' (They called Janie 'Alphabet' because so many people had given her different names.) After looking at the picture for a long time and recognizing her dress and hair, Janie exclaimed 'Aw, aw! Ah'm colored!' - realizing for the first time that she was different from the white children she had grown up with.",
