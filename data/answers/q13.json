  "question": "Why and how did Johnny Taylor upset Nanny?",
  "answer": "Johnny Taylor upset Nanny by kissing Janie over the front gatepost. Nanny woke from her sleep to see Johnny Taylor kissing her granddaughter, which horrified her. Nanny viewed Johnny Taylor as 'trashy' and 'shiftless' - a poor, worthless man ('breath-and-britches') who was not good enough for Janie. This kiss represented Janie's transition into womanhood and sexuality, which frightened Nanny because she feared Janie would be exploited by men like Johnny Taylor. The incident prompted Nanny to immediately arrange Janie's marriage to Logan Killicks, a respectable older man with property, to protect Janie from such unsuitable suitors.",
  "quote": "She bolted upright and peered out of the window and saw Johnny Taylor lacerating her Janie with a kiss... 'Whut Ah seen just now is plenty for me, honey, Ah don't want no trashy nigger, no breath-and-britches, lak Johnny Taylor usin' yo' body to wipe his foots on.'",
