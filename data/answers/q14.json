  "question": "What specific episode marked the end of Janie's childhood?",
  "answer": "The specific episode that marked the end of Janie's childhood was her kiss with Johnny Taylor at the gatepost. This kiss occurred after Janie's transformative experience under the blossoming pear tree, where she witnessed the bees pollinating the blooms and had a sexual and spiritual awakening about love and marriage. In a state of heightened awareness and longing, she went to the front gate where she saw Johnny Taylor approaching. When Nanny caught them kissing, she called Janie inside, and the narrator explicitly states: 'That was the end of her childhood.' This moment triggered Nanny's decision to marry Janie off to Logan Killicks for protection and security.",
  "quote": "She bolted upright and peered out of the window and saw Johnny Taylor lacerating her Janie with a kiss... So she extended herself outside of her dream and went inside of the house. That was the end of her childhood.",
