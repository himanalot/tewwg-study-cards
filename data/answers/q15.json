  "question": "Why did Nanny favor Logan Killicks over Johnny Taylor?",
  "answer": "Nanny favored Logan Killicks over Johnny Taylor primarily because Logan offered security, protection, and material stability that Johnny Taylor could not provide. Nanny dismisses Johnny Taylor as a 'trashy nigger' and 'breath-and-britches' (someone with nothing but the clothes on his back), viewing him as someone who would only use Janie. In contrast, Logan Killicks is described as 'a good man' who owns a house 'bought and paid for' and 'sixty acres uh land right on de big road.' Nanny's deeper motivation stems from her experiences in slavery and her fear that without protection, Janie would become 'de mule uh de world' like other Black women. She explicitly tells Janie that what she wants for her is not Logan Killicks himself, but 'protection.' As an elderly woman who knows she will die soon, Nanny wants to see Janie 'safe in life' before she passes, protected from being 'kicked around from pillar tuh post.' Logan's property and stability represent safety and dignity that Nanny never had as a slave, while Johnny Taylor represents the vulnerability and exploitation she fears for her granddaughter.",
