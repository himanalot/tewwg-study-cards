  "question": "Why did Nanny violently slap Janie's face?",
  "answer": "Nanny slapped Janie because she caught Janie kissing Johnny Taylor at the gate, and when Nanny confronted her about it and insisted she must marry Logan Killicks for protection, Janie pouted and refused to respond. Nanny was frustrated by Janie's defiant silence and her fear that Janie would end up like her mother (who had been raped). Nanny saw the kiss as a sign that Janie had reached womanhood and was vulnerable to being taken advantage of by 'trashy' men. When Janie hunched over and pouted at the floor instead of answering, Nanny slapped her to force Janie to look at her and understand the seriousness of the situation.",
  "quote": "She slapped the girl's face violently, and forced her head back so that their eyes met in struggle. With her hand uplifted for the second blow she saw the huge tear that welled up from Janie's heart and stood in each eye. She saw the terrible agony and the lips tightened down to hold back the cry and desisted.",
  "context_quote": "You answer me when Ah speak. Don't you set dere poutin' wid me after all Ah done went through for you!",
  "trigger_quote": "In the last stages of Nanny's sleep, she dreamed of voices... She bolted upright and peered out of the window and saw Johnny Taylor lacerating her Janie with a kiss.",
