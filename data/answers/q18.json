  "question": "According to Nanny, who or what is the 'mule uh de world'?",
  "answer": "According to Nanny, the black woman (specifically 'de nigger woman') is the 'mule uh de world.' Nanny explains this metaphor to Janie by describing a hierarchy of oppression: the white man is the ruler who throws down the load, the black man picks it up but passes it on to black women, making black women the ultimate burden-bearers of society - like mules who carry everyone's loads.",
  "quote": "Honey, de white man is de ruler of everything as fur as Ah been able tuh find out. Maybe it's some place way off in de ocean where de black man is in power, but we don't know nothin' but what we see. So de white man throw down de load and tell de nigger man tuh pick it up. He pick it up because he have to, but he don't tote it. He hand it to his womenfolks. De nigger woman is de mule uh de world so fur as Ah can see. Ah been prayin' fuh it tuh be different wid you. Lawd, Lawd, Lawd!",
