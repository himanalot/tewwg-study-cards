  "question": "Why does Nanny claim that the black woman is the 'mule uh the world'?",
  "answer": "Nanny explains that the black woman is 'de mule uh de world' because she bears the burden that is passed down through a hierarchy of oppression. According to Nanny, the white man is 'de ruler of everything' and when he has a load to carry, he throws it down and tells the black man to pick it up. The black man picks it up because he has to, but he doesn't carry it himself - instead, he hands it to his womenfolks. Thus, the black woman ends up at the bottom of this chain, carrying the burdens that have been passed down from white men to black men and finally to her. Like a mule, she is forced to bear the heaviest loads while having the least power. Nanny shares this painful observation with Janie because she has been praying for Janie's life to be different from this pattern of exploitation.",
