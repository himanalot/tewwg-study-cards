  "question": "How does Nanny's background and history lead her to respect and admire somebody like Logan Killicks?",
  "answer": "Nanny's traumatic experiences during slavery fundamentally shape her values and lead her to admire Logan Killicks for his material security rather than romantic qualities. Born into slavery, Nanny was sexually exploited by her master, resulting in a mixed-race daughter (Leafy). When the mistress discovered the baby's light features, she threatened to have Nanny whipped with one hundred lashes and sell the child. Nanny fled into the swamp, hiding among snakes and panthers to protect her baby until freedom came. These harrowing experiences taught Nanny that for Black women, survival and protection are paramount - she describes Black women as 'de mule uh de world.' After freedom, her daughter Leafy was raped by a schoolteacher, reinforcing Nanny's belief that Black women need male protection and material security. Logan Killicks represents everything Nanny never had: sixty acres of land, a house 'bought and paid for,' respectability (people must 'tip dey hat' and call Janie 'Mis' Killicks'), and the ability to provide protection. For Nanny, who was 'used for a work-ox and a brood-sow,' Logan's property and stability symbolize freedom from exploitation. When Janie complains about not loving Logan, Nanny dismisses love as 'de very prong all us black women gits hung on' - a luxury that leads to suffering. Nanny's definition of a 'good life' is sitting on a porch like white women did, having security, and being protected from abuse - not romantic fulfillment.",
