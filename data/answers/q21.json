  "question": "Why was Nanny whipped when she was younger?",
  "answer": "Nanny was threatened with whipping because her baby (Leafy) was fathered by the master of the plantation. When the mistress saw that Nanny's baby had gray eyes and yellow hair - clear evidence that the baby was mixed race and fathered by her husband - she became enraged. The mistress slapped Nanny and threatened to have her taken to the whipping post the next morning for one hundred lashes. Nanny escaped that night with her baby to the swamp to avoid the punishment.",

But first thing in de mornin' de overseer will take you to de whippin' post and tie you down on yo' knees and cut de hide offa yo' yaller back. One hundred lashes wid a raw-hide on yo' bare back. Ah'll have you whipped till de blood run down to yo' heels!'",
