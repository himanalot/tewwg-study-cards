  "question": "How was Janie conceived?",
  "answer": "Janie was conceived when her mother Leafy, who was only seventeen years old, was raped by her school teacher. Nanny (Janie's grandmother) had been raising Leafy and had put her in school with hopes of making her a school teacher. One day Leafy didn't come home, and the next morning she came crawling back on her hands and knees after the school teacher had hidden her in the woods all night and raped her. By the time Leafy recovered, they knew she was pregnant with Janie. After Janie was born, Leafy took to drinking and staying out at night, eventually abandoning Janie to be raised by Nanny.",
