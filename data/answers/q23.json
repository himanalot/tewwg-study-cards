  "question": "What were Nanny's final words before she died?",
  "answer": "Nanny's final words were a prayer spoken towards morning after spending all night on her knees in her shack. She muttered: 'Lawd, you know mah heart. Ah done de best Ah could do. De rest is left to you.' After speaking these words, she scuffled up from her knees and fell heavily across the bed. A month later she was dead. These words express her surrender to God after doing everything she could to protect Janie, acknowledging that her work was done and the rest was in God's hands.",
