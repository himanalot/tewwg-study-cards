  "question": "How did Janie react to the physical appearance of Logan Killicks?",
  "answer": "Janie reacted with visceral disgust to Logan Killicks' physical appearance. When Nanny first tells her about Logan's marriage proposal, Janie immediately rejects him by comparing him to a skull in a graveyard. Later, in a conversation with Nanny after the marriage, Janie provides a detailed catalog of her physical revulsion: she hates the shape of his head (long one way and flat on the sides), the fat on his neck, his big belly, and his toenails that look like mule feet. She is also repulsed by his lack of hygiene, noting that he doesn't wash his feet before coming to bed despite her placing the water for him. Janie says she would rather be 'shot with tacks' than turn over in bed and stir up the air while he is there. The vision of Logan 'desecrated' her romantic vision of the pear tree, symbolizing how his unromantic, unpleasant appearance destroyed her idealistic dreams of love and marriage.",
