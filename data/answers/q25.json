  "question": "Under what circumstances did Janie first come to meet Jody?",
  "answer": "Janie first met Joe Starks (Jody) while she was still married to Logan Killicks. Logan had gone to buy a mule, leaving Janie at home cutting up seed potatoes. Janie moved outside to sit under an oak tree in the yard where she could see the road. A stylish, citified man came walking down the road whistling. Janie ran to the pump and jerked the handle hard to make noise and attract his attention, which also made her long hair fall down. Joe stopped and asked her for a cool drink of water. They began talking, and he introduced himself as Joe Starks from Georgia. He told her about his plans to go to the new all-black town being built in Florida where he hoped to become a big voice. When he learned she was married and expected to plow behind a mule, he told her she deserved better - to sit on a front porch and be treated like a lady. They continued meeting secretly in the scrub oaks across the road over the following days until Janie eventually decided to leave Logan and run away with Jody.",
  "quote": "It was a cityfied, stylish dressed man with his hat set at an angle that didn't belong in these parts. His coat was over his arm, but he didn't need it to represent his clothes. The shirt with the silk sleeve-holders was dazzling enough for the world. He whistled, mopped his face and walked like he knew where he was going... Janie ran to the pump and jerked the handle hard while she pumped. It made a loud noise and also made her heavy hair fall down. So he stopped and looked hard, and then he asked her for a cool drink of water.",
