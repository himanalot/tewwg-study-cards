  "question": "How did Janie silence Hicks the first time he tried to flirt with her?",
  "answer": "When Hicks attempted to flirt with Janie while Joe was away, he tried to engage her in conversation but Janie gave him only short, dismissive responses ('Ah reckon so,' 'Much obliged'). When Hicks grew frustrated and sarcastically remarked 'Folks must be mighty close-mouthed where you come from,' Janie silenced him with a clever retort: 'Dat's right. But it must be different at yo' home.' This witty comeback turned his insult back on him, implying he came from a place where people were too talkative or forward. Hicks was left speechless and eventually stumbled away with a surly goodbye.",
