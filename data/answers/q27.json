  "question": "What item did Joe Starks buy from Sears and Roebuck that helped advance his fame in the town of Eatonville?",
  "answer": "Joe Starks bought a street lamp from Sears, Roebuck and Company. This was the first street lamp in a colored town, and Joe made it into a major event by organizing a lamplighting ceremony with a barbecue feast, inviting people from all around Orange County. The lamp became a source of pride for the whole town and enhanced Joe's reputation as a progressive leader.",
  "quote": "The very next day with money out of his own pocket he sent off to Sears, Roebuck and Company for the street lamp and told the town to meet the following Thursday night to vote on it. Nobody had ever thought of street lamps and some of them said it was a useless notion. They went so far as to vote against it, but the majority ruled. But the whole town got vain over it after it came... Dis occasion is something for us all tuh remember tuh our dyin' day. De first street lamp in uh colored town.",
