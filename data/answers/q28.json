  "question": "What did Joe Starks' house look like?",
  "answer": "Joe Starks' house was a grand two-story building with porches and bannisters, painted a 'gloaty, sparkly white.' It was so impressive compared to the other homes in Eatonville that the rest of the town looked like 'servants' quarters surrounding the big house.' The white paint was compared to the elegant homes of wealthy white people like Bishop Whipple, W. B. Jackson, and the Vanderpools. Joe waited until the house was completely painted inside and out before moving in, setting himself apart from the other residents. The house symbolized Joe's ambition and desire to emulate the power and status of white landowners, essentially making himself the 'big massa' of the all-Black town.",
  "quote": "Take for instance that new house of his. It had two stories with porches, with bannisters and such things. The rest of the town looked like servants' quarters surrounding the 'big house.' And different from everybody else in the town he put off moving in until it had been painted, in and out. And look at the way he painted it—a gloaty, sparkly white. The kind of promenading white that the houses of Bishop Whipple, W. B. Jackson and the Vanderpool's wore.",
