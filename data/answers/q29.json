  "question": "What special item did Joe buy for Janie that made other people feel that Joe had taken advantage of them?",
  "answer": "Joe bought Janie a little lady-size spittoon (spitting pot) decorated with little sprigs of flowers painted all around the sides. This fancy item made the townspeople feel taken advantage of because they had been spitting in tomato cans, not knowing that 'up-to-date folks' used such elegant flowered spittoons. It made them feel like things had been kept from them.",
  "quote": "He bought a little lady-size spitting pot for Janie to spit in. Had it right in the parlor with little sprigs of flowers painted all around the sides. It took people by surprise because most of the women dipped snuff and of course had a spit-cup in the house. But how could they know up-to-date folks was spitting in flowery little things like that? It sort of made the rest of them feel that they had been taken advantage of. Like things had been kept from them. Maybe more things in the world besides spitting pots had been hid from them, when they wasn't told no better than to spit in tomato cans.",
