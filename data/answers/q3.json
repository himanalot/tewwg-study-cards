  "question": "What kind of clothing is Janie wearing at the beginning of the novel?",
  "answer": "Janie is wearing a faded shirt and muddy overalls when she returns to Eatonville at the beginning of the novel. This working-class attire is notable because it contrasts with her previous status as the wealthy widow of Joe Starks, and the townswomen on the porch take note of her clothing as potential evidence of her fall from grace.",
  "quote": "The women took the faded shirt and muddy overalls and laid them away for remembrance. It was a weapon against her strength and if it turned out of no significance, still it was a hope that she might fall to their level some day.",
