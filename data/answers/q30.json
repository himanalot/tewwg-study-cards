  "question": "Why did Joe make Henry Pitts leave town?",
  "answer": "Joe Starks caught Henry Pitts stealing a wagon load of his ribbon cane (sugarcane). Joe confiscated the stolen cane and banished Henry Pitts from the town. Some townspeople thought Joe was too harsh, given how much cane and property he already had, but they only voiced these opinions when Joe wasn't around to hear them.",
  "quote": "Like one day after he caught Henry Pitts with a wagon load of his ribbon cane and took the cane away from Pitts and made him leave town. Some of them thought Starks ought not to have done that. He had so much cane and everything else.",
