  "question": "Why did the citizens of Eatonville frequently make fun of Matt Bonner?",
  "answer": "The citizens of Eatonville frequently made fun of Matt Bonner because of his skinny, mistreated yellow mule. The mule was so emaciated that the townspeople joked about women using its rib bones as a washboard and hanging things on its hock-bones to dry. They teased Matt relentlessly about not feeding the mule properly, with Sam, Lige, and Walter being the ringleaders of the 'mule-talkers.' The mule became the second most prominent topic of conversation in town after Mayor Starks himself, and provided endless entertainment for the porch-sitters at the store.",
  "quote": "Take for instance the case of Matt Bonner's yellow mule. They had him up for conversation every day the Lord sent. Most especial if Matt was there himself to listen. Sam and Lige and Walter were the ringleaders of the mule-talkers... 'Yeah, Matt, dat mule so skinny till de women is usin' his rib bones fuh uh rub-board, and hangin' things out on his hock-bones tuh dry.'",
