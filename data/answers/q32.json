  "question": "What did Joe force Janie to wear while she worked in the store?",
  "answer": "Joe forced Janie to wear a head rag (also called a head kerchief) to cover and tie up her hair while she worked in the store. He was jealous of the attention other men paid to Janie's beautiful, long hair and wanted to hide it from their view.",
  "quote": "This business of the head-rag irked her endlessly. But Jody was set on it. Her hair was NOT going to show in the store. It didn't seem sensible at all. That was because Joe never told Janie how jealous he was. He never told her how often he had seen the other men figuratively wallowing in it as she went about things in the store... That night he ordered Janie to tie up her hair around the store. That was all. She was there in the store for him to look at, not those others.",
