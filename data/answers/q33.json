  "question": "Why did he make her wear this?",
  "answer": "Joe (Jody) made Janie wear a head-rag in the store because he was intensely jealous of her beautiful long hair attracting other men's attention. He had observed other men 'figuratively wallowing' in her hair as she went about the store, and one night he caught Walter standing behind Janie, secretly brushing his hand back and forth across her braid to feel it. This enraged Joe so much he wanted to chop off Walter's hand with a meat knife. That night, he ordered Janie to tie up her hair. Joe wanted Janie to be 'there in the store for him to look at, not those others,' but his possessiveness and jealousy prevented him from ever explaining his true reasons to her.",
  "quote": "This business of the head-rag irked her endlessly. But Jody was set on it. Her hair was NOT going to show in the store. It didn't seem sensible at all. That was because Joe never told Janie how jealous he was. He never told her how often he had seen the other men figuratively wallowing in it as she went about things in the store. And one night he had caught Walter standing behind Janie and brushing the back of his hand back and forth across the loose end of her braid ever so lightly so as to enjoy the feel of it without Janie knowing what he was doing. Joe was at the back of the store and Walter didn't see him. He felt like rushing forth with the meat knife and chopping off the offending hand. That night he ordered Janie to tie up her hair around the store. That was all. She was there in the store for him to look at, not those others.",
