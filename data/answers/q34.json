  "question": "Why did Janie once compare her husband to Abe Lincoln and George Washington?",
  "answer": "Janie compared Joe Starks to Abraham Lincoln and George Washington after he bought Matt Bonner's old, mistreated mule for five dollars and set it free, allowing it to live comfortably in town. She praised Joe publicly, saying that just as Lincoln freed the enslaved people because he had the power to rule the United States, Joe freed a mule because he had the power to rule his town. She told him that having the power to free things makes him 'lak uh king uh something.' This comparison elevated Joe's act of buying the mule's freedom to a heroic, presidential level of benevolence and authority.",
  "quote": "Jody, dat wuz uh mighty fine thing fuh you tuh do. 'Tain't everybody would have thought of it, 'cause it ain't no everyday thought. Freein' dat mule makes uh mighty big man outa you. Something like George Washington and Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln, he had de whole United States tuh rule so he freed de Negroes. You got uh town so you freed uh mule. You have tuh have power tuh free things and dat makes you lak uh king uh something.",
