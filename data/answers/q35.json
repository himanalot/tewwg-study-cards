  "question": "Why wouldn't Jody allow Janie to attend a mule's funeral?",
  "answer": "Joe (Jody) refused to let Janie attend the mule's mock funeral (dragging-out) because he believed it was beneath her status as the Mayor's wife. He felt that she should not be seen mingling with common people in such a chaotic, undignified event. Joe was obsessed with class distinctions and propriety, and he saw the funeral as a gathering of 'no-manners' common folk engaging in 'commonness' that was unsuitable for someone of Janie's elevated social position. While Joe could attend because he was 'a man even if he is the Mayor,' he believed 'the mayor's wife is somethin' different again' and held her to a higher standard of public behavior. This reflects Joe's controlling nature and his view of Janie as a symbol of his status rather than as an individual with her own desires.",
  "quote": "Joe was struck speechless for a minute. 'Why, Janie! You wouldn't be seen at uh draggin'-out, wouldja? Wid any and everybody in uh passle pushin' and shovin' wid they no-manners selves? Naw, naw!' ... 'Dat's right, but Ah'm uh man even if Ah is de Mayor. But de mayor's wife is somethin' different again. Anyhow they's liable tuh need me tuh say uh few words over de carcass, dis bein' uh special case. But you ain't goin' off in all dat mess uh commonness. Ah'm surprised at yuh fuh askin'.'",
