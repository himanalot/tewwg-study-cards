  "question": "Why did Jody strike Janie for the first time?",
  "answer": "Jody struck Janie for the first time because she ruined dinner. The bread didn't rise, the fish wasn't quite done at the bone, and the rice was scorched. Joe had looked forward to his dinner as a refuge from other things, and when the meal turned out poorly, he slapped Janie until she had a ringing sound in her ears. This moment marks a significant turning point in their marriage, as Janie realizes that her idealized image of Jody has shattered. She was twenty-four years old and had been married for seven years when this incident occurred.",
  "quote": "She found that out one day when he slapped her face in the kitchen. It happened over one of those dinners that chasten all women sometimes. They plan and they fix and they do, and then some kitchen-dwelling fiend slips a scorchy, soggy, tasteless mess into their pots and pans. Janie was a good cook, and Joe had looked forward to his dinner as a refuge from other things. So when the bread didn't rise, and the fish wasn't quite done at the bone, and the rice was scorched, he slapped Janie until she had a ringing sound in her ears and told her about her brains before he stalked on back to the store.",
