  "question": "What kind of ritual did Joe Starks go through with Mrs. Robbins?",
  "answer": "Joe Starks went through a begging ritual with Mrs. Tony Robbins where she would come to his store and dramatically beg for meat, claiming she and her children were starving because her husband Tony 'don't fee-eed' her. Joe would pretend to be annoyed, then reluctantly agree to give her meat. He would cut a smaller piece than she requested, she would dramatically protest, and then when he pretended to put it back, she would quickly grab it and leave while complaining about his stinginess. This was a regular performance that entertained the porch sitters, and Tony had asked Joe to 'humor her along.'",
  "quote": "He was baiting Mrs. Tony Robbins as he always did when she came to the store... Mrs. Robbins struck her pity-pose and assumed the voice. 'Cause Ah'm hongry, Mist' Starks. 'Deed Ah is. Me and mah chillun is hongry. Tony don't fee-eed me!' This was what the porch was waiting for. They burst into a laugh... Starks made as if to throw the meat back in the box and close it. Mrs. Tony swooped like lightning and seized it, and started towards the door.",
