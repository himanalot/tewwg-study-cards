  "question": "How did Joe Starks change physically as he began to age?",
  "answer": "As Joe Starks aged, his body underwent significant physical deterioration. He no longer sat down normally but fell into chairs. His knees weakened so that he no longer reared back confidently but squatted over his ankles when walking. His neck became stiff and still. His once-prominent, pugnacious belly that used to intimidate people began to sag like a suspended load, no longer appearing to be part of him. His eyes became absent and distant. As his condition worsened, his back ached constantly, his muscle dissolved into fat, and then the fat melted off his bones. Near his death, Janie could see through his thin counterpane what was left of his belly huddled before him on the bed like some helpless thing seeking shelter.",
  "quote": "Joe wasn't so young as he used to be. There was already something dead about him. He didn't rear back in his knees any longer. He squatted over his ankles when he walked. That stillness at the back of his neck. His prosperous-looking belly that used to thrust out so pugnaciously and intimidate folks, sagged like a load suspended from his loins. It didn't seem to be a part of him anymore. Eyes a little absent too.",
