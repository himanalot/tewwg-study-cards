  "question": "What circumstances led Joe to strike Janie the second time -- the time that 'drove her from the store'?",
  "answer": "The incident began when Steve Mixon asked for chewing tobacco and Janie cut the plug incorrectly. The tobacco knife was stiff and she fumbled with it, cutting 'way away from the mark.' Mixon held it up as a harmless joke, and the store crowd laughed good-naturedly. But Joe, who had been increasingly ridiculing Janie in public to deflect attention from his own declining health and aging body, did not laugh. He re-cut the tobacco and publicly humiliated Janie, mocking her inability to cut tobacco after years in the store and insulting her appearance by saying her 'rump hangin' nearly to yo' knees.' For the first time, Janie talked back publicly, telling Joe to stop mixing up her work with her looks. The confrontation escalated until Janie delivered a devastating blow to Joe's masculinity, declaring that when he pulls down his pants, he looks 'lak de change uh life.' This public emasculation in front of the men of Eatonville was unbearable to Joe. He felt she had 'robbed him of his illusion of irresistible maleness' and 'cast down his empty armor before men.' In response to this humiliation, Joe struck Janie with all his might and drove her from the store.",
  "quote": "So one day Steve Mixon wanted some chewing tobacco and Janie cut it wrong. She hated that tobacco knife anyway. It worked very stiff. She fumbled with the thing and cut way away from the mark... Jody didn't laugh. He hurried across from the post office side and took the plug of tobacco away from Mixon and cut it again. Cut it exactly on the mark and glared at Janie. 'I god amighty! A woman stay round uh store till she get old as Methusalem and still can't cut a little thing like a plug of tobacco! Don't stand dere rollin' yo' pop eyes at me wid yo' rump hangin' nearly to yo' knees!'... Then too, Janie took the middle of the floor to talk right into Jody's face, and that was something that hadn't been done before... 'Talkin' 'bout me lookin' old! When you pull down yo' britches, you look lak de change uh life.'... Then Joe Starks realized all the meanings and his vanity bled like a flood. Janie had robbed him of his illusion of irresistible maleness that all men cherish... So he struck Janie with all his might and drove her from the store.",
