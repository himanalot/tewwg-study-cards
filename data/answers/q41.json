  "question": "Why did Joe start to see a 'root-doctor'?",
  "answer": "Joe started seeing a root-doctor (also called a 'two-headed doctor') because he was dying from kidney failure but refused to accept a medical explanation for his illness. Despite having always been 'scornful of root-doctors,' Joe became desperate as his health declined. He believed that his sickness was caused by conjure or hoodoo - specifically that something had been 'buried against him' (a curse). The root-doctor also fed Joe's suspicions that Janie was poisoning him, which drove a further wedge between them. Rather than accepting medical treatment, Joe convinced himself that he would recover once the root-doctor found and removed the curse. This reflects both his denial about dying and his growing paranoia toward Janie in his final days.",

  "quote_additional": "He had always been scornful of root-doctors and all their kind, but now she saw a faker from over around Altamonte Springs, hanging around the place almost daily.",
