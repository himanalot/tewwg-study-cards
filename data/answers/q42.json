  "question": "What rumors were the people of Eatonville spreading about Janie's treatment of her husband?",
  "answer": "The people of Eatonville spread rumors that Janie had 'fixed' Joe Starks, meaning she had placed a voodoo curse or conjure spell on him to make him sick. Janie was accused of poisoning her husband. This rumor was started by a 'two-headed doctor' (a voodoo practitioner/root doctor) who was trying to gain Joe's trust and business by suggesting that his illness was caused by supernatural means rather than natural causes. The rumor spread through the town after the public confrontation between Janie and Joe in the store, when Janie humiliated him by insulting his manhood.",
