  "question": "Why did the word 'kidney' force Janie to think about death?",
  "answer": "When the doctor from Orlando diagnosed Joe Starks with kidney failure, he told Janie that it was 'just a matter of time' because when a man's kidneys stop working altogether, there is no way for him to live. The doctor explained that Joe had needed medical attention two years earlier, but it was now too late. This terminal diagnosis forced Janie to confront the reality of Joe's impending death. The word 'kidney' became synonymous with a death sentence, triggering Janie's contemplation of Death as a personified figure - a strange being with huge square toes who lived in the West, standing watchful and motionless with his sword drawn back, waiting to claim Joe. The kidney diagnosis made death inevitable and immediate rather than abstract, forcing Janie to accept that she would soon find 'a feather from his wings lying in her yard.'",
