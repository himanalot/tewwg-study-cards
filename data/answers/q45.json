  "question": "What does Janie see in the looking glass at the end of chapter 8?",
  "answer": "When Janie looks in the looking glass (mirror) at the end of Chapter 8, after Joe dies, she sees that the young girl she once was is gone, but a handsome woman has taken her place. She also lets down her hair and sees that its weight, length, and glory are still there. This moment represents Janie's self-rediscovery and liberation after years of suppression under Joe's control.",
  "quote": "Years ago, she had told her girl self to wait for her in the looking glass. It had been a long time since she had remembered. Perhaps she'd better look. She went over to the dresser and looked hard at her skin and features. The young girl was gone, but a handsome woman had taken her place. She tore off the kerchief from her head and let down her plentiful hair. The weight, the length, the glory was there.",
