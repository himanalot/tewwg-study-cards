  "question": "Why do scores of men begin to offer their services to Janie at the beginning of chapter 9?",
  "answer": "Men begin pursuing Janie at the beginning of Chapter 9 because she is now a wealthy, attractive widow. Her 'widowhood and property' represent a 'great challenge' to men in South Florida. She owns Joe Starks' store, collects rents from tenants, and has significant property - making her financially desirable. Additionally, she is described as 'too pretty for de mens tuh leave yuh alone' and 'too young uh 'oman tuh stay single.' The combination of her beauty and inherited wealth draws numerous suitors who drive 'considerable distances' to offer their services as advisors, though Janie sees through their pretenses, recognizing that 'most of the others were poor' women they knew, and these men were specifically targeting her because of her wealth.",
  "quote": "Janie found out very soon that her widowhood and property was a great challenge in South Florida. Before Jody had been dead a month, she noticed how often men who had never been intimates of Joe, drove considerable distances to ask after her welfare and offer their services as advisor.",
