  "question": "Who was Hezekiah and how did he treat Janie?",
  "answer": "Hezekiah Potts was the seventeen-year-old delivery boy who worked at Joe Starks's store. After Joe's death, Hezekiah treated Janie like a 'baby-sister,' being protective and caring toward her. He tried to imitate Joe Starks in every way - smoking cigars, using Joe's expressions like 'I god,' sitting in Joe's swivel chair, and even trying to push out his belly to look like Joe's paunch. His 'sense of ownership' made him honest and reliable. When Tea Cake started showing interest in Janie, Hezekiah was protective, warning her that Tea Cake 'ain't got doodly squat' and offering to walk her home himself instead. Janie found his imitations of Joe amusing and appreciated his help running the store, noting she 'wouldn't know what to do without him.'",
  "quote": "But she hid that feeling by sending Hezekiah who was the best imitation of Joe that his seventeen years could make. He had even taken to smoking, and smoking cigars, since Joe's death and tried to bite 'em tight in one side of his mouth like Joe... His acting didn't hurt nobody and she wouldn't know what to do without him. He sensed that and came to treat her like baby-sister, as if to say 'You poor little thing, give it to big brother. He'll fix it for you.'",
