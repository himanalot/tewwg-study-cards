  "question": "What kind of relationship developed between Phoeby Watson, Janie, and the Sanford undertaker?",
  "answer": "Pheoby Watson served as a go-between or matchmaker between Janie and a Sanford undertaker who was courting Janie after Joe Starks's death. The undertaker, a widower with a nice furnished home, was 'pressing his cause through Pheoby,' using her as an intermediary to pursue Janie romantically. Pheoby supported this match and tried to encourage Janie toward the undertaker, believing he was a safe, respectable choice who had property to match Janie's wealth. When Janie became involved with Tea Cake instead, Pheoby expressed disappointment and tried to convince Janie that the Sanford undertaker would be a better, more 'endurable' match. However, Janie showed no real romantic interest in the undertaker, merely 'listening pleasantly but undisturbed' to his advances through Pheoby.",
