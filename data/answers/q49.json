  "question": "Who was Vergible Woods?",
  "answer": "Vergible Woods is Tea Cake's real name. Tea Cake is a charming, fun-loving younger man who becomes Janie's third husband and the love of her life. He meets Janie in Eatonville after Joe Starks dies, and they eventually marry and move to the Everglades (the muck) to work as migrant farmers. His nickname 'Tea Cake' reflects his sweet, playful personality. Tragically, Tea Cake dies after being bitten by a rabid dog during the hurricane, and Janie is forced to shoot him in self-defense when he attacks her in his rabies-induced madness. The court rules his death 'entirely accidental and justifiable.'",
