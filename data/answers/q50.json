  "question": "What specific circumstances led Vergible Woods to Janie?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake (Vergible Woods) came to Janie's store due to a mix-up about a baseball game. He thought the game was being held at Hungerford, so he got a ride to where the road turns off from the Dixie Highway and walked to Eatonville, only to discover the game was actually in Winter Park. Since everyone in town had gone to the game and all the cars were gone, he couldn't get to Winter Park. Finding Janie alone in the store (Hezekiah had asked off to go to the game), he came in to buy cigarettes (Camels) and ended up staying to teach her how to play checkers, which began their relationship.",
