  "question": "In what specific ways was Tea Cake a different sort of man in contrast to Logan Killicks and Jody?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake differed from Logan Killicks and Jody Starks in several fundamental ways. First, he treated Janie as an equal partner rather than as property or a symbol of status. Unlike Logan, who wanted Janie to work in the fields plowing and moving manure, and unlike Jody, who wanted her to 'sit wid folded hands' as a trophy wife of the mayor, Tea Cake engaged Janie in playful companionship. He taught her to play checkers (something Jody said was 'too heavy fuh mah brains'), went fishing with her at midnight, took her hunting, to movies, dances, and baseball games. When Tea Cake set up the checkerboard, 'she found herself glowing inside. Somebody wanted her to play. Somebody thought it natural for her to play.' This was revolutionary - neither previous husband had thought it natural for Janie to participate in leisure activities. Second, Tea Cake brought fun and spontaneity into her life. Going fishing after midnight made Janie feel 'like a child breaking rules,' experiencing joy and adventure for the first time. Third, Tea Cake showed genuine affection and intimacy - combing her hair, telling her she was beautiful, picking out colors for her to wear. As Janie explained to Pheoby: 'Ah always did want tuh git round uh whole heap, but Jody wouldn't 'low me tuh... Ah wants tuh utilize mahself all over.' Tea Cake allowed and encouraged her full self-expression, while Logan wanted a work mule and Jody wanted a silent ornament.",
