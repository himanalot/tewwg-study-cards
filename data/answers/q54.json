  "question": "Why did Janie almost fall asleep while hanging on a newel post?",
  "answer": "Janie almost fell asleep hanging over the newel post because she was deep in thought after Tea Cake's sudden departure following their emotionally charged conversation. Tea Cake had just confessed his feelings for her, saying he'd 'ruther be shot wid tacks' than have her treat him coldly. After he 'almost ran out of the door,' Janie stood at the newel post processing conflicting thoughts and emotions - initial joy ('lit up like a transfiguration'), then doubt (thinking he was just saying anything to make her believe him), then resignation about their age difference. She was so absorbed in thinking about Tea Cake and what his words meant that she nearly fell asleep standing there. Before going to bed, she examined herself in the mirror - her mouth, eyes, and hair - showing she was contemplating herself as a romantic object through Tea Cake's eyes.",
