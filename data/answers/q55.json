  "question": "Why did Tea Cake make it a point to visit Janie very early in the morning when their relationship was just developing?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake visited Janie early in the morning to prove that his feelings for her were genuine and not just romantic notions that came at night. By coming at daybreak, he wanted to show her his 'daytime thoughts' and 'daytime feelings,' demonstrating that his affection was sincere and constant, not something that faded in the clear light of day. This gesture addressed Janie's doubts about whether his intentions were real, as she had questioned whether his feelings were just 'night thoughts' that would disappear by morning. Tea Cake's early visit, bringing strawberries he had picked, was his way of proving his love was genuine and worthy of her trust.",
