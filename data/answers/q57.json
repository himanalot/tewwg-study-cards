  "question": "What rumors or accusations did the men of Eatonville make against Tea Cake when they first noticed he was spending time with Janie?",
  "answer": "The men of Eatonville accused Tea Cake of being after Janie's money and planning to spend her wealth. They believed he was 'spendin' on her now in order tuh make her spend on him later' - essentially that he was using his charm and attention as an investment to eventually drain her inheritance from Joe Starks. Sam Watson told Pheoby that 'Tea Cake can't do nothin' but help her spend whut she got' and that he was 'Throwin' away whut Joe Starks worked hard tuh git tuhgether.' The Pastor accused Tea Cake of keeping Janie away from church so he could have the money she would have given in offering to 'buy gas wid.' The townspeople compared Janie's situation to that of Annie Tyler, an older widow who was swindled by a younger man named 'Who Flung' who took all her money and abandoned her. The men were also critical that Tea Cake had no money of his own ('he ain't got uh dime tuh cry') and was younger than Janie, making his motives suspicious.",
