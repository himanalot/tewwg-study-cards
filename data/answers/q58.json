  "question": "Janie says 'it would be a complete flommuck'. What does she mean by this?",
  "answer": "By 'flommuck,' Janie means a complete failure, disaster, or mess. She is explaining to Pheoby why she is selling the store before marrying Tea Cake. Janie recognizes that Tea Cake is fundamentally different from her late husband Jody Starks - Tea Cake is not a businessman or someone who pursues property and status. If Tea Cake tried to run the store and be like Jody, it would be a total disaster because that is not who he is. Additionally, everyone in town would constantly compare Tea Cake unfavorably to Jody if they stayed. Instead, Janie plans to leave Eatonville and 'start all over in Tea Cake's way' because their relationship is 'uh love game' rather than 'a business proposition' or 'a race after property and titles.'",
