  "question": "Who was Annie Tyler and what happened to her? Why did Phoeby remind Janie about her?",
  "answer": "Annie Tyler was a fifty-two-year-old widow from Eatonville who had been left with a good home and insurance money. She was known in the town for dyeing her hair, wearing uncomfortable false teeth and high-heeled slippers, and having love affairs with much younger men in their late teens and early twenties. She would spend her money on suits, shoes, and watches for these young men, who would leave her as soon as their wants were satisfied. When her ready cash ran out, a young man nicknamed 'Who Flung' came along, denounced her previous lover as a scoundrel, and moved in with her. He persuaded her to sell her house and go to Tampa with him. Once there, he took her to a shabby room in a shabby house, promised to marry her the next day, stayed with her for two days, and then disappeared with all her money. Annie Tyler was left broken, humiliated, and destitute. She eventually made it back to Maitland on the train, looking aged and worn, with her pride completely gone. Her married daughter took her away to die in peace. The narrator observes poignantly: 'She had waited all her life for something, and it had killed her when it found her.' Phoeby reminded Janie about Annie Tyler as a warning because Janie was also an older widow with money who was planning to sell out and go off with a younger man (Tea Cake). Phoeby was concerned that Janie might suffer the same fate as Annie Tyler - being used for her money and then abandoned. However, Janie distinguished herself from Annie Tyler, saying 'Ah ain't Mis' Tyler and Tea Cake ain't no Who Flung.'",
  "quote": "She was broken and her pride was gone, so she told those who asked what had happened. Who Flung had taken her to a shabby room in a shabby house in a shabby street and promised to marry her next day. They stayed in the room two whole days then she woke up to find Who Flung and her money gone... She had waited all her life for something, and it had killed her when it found her.",
