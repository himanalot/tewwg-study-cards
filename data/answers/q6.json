  "question": "What does Hurston mean at the beginning of the chapter when she says the men of Eatonville were 'saving with the mind what they lost with the eye'?",
  "answer": "Hurston means that as Janie walks past the men on the porch, they are mentally storing and memorizing the visual details of her physical appearance - particularly her attractive features like her 'firm buttocks,' her long black hair 'swinging to her waist,' and her 'pugnacious breasts' - because they know she will soon be out of their sight. The phrase captures the men's lustful gaze and their desire to hold onto the image of Janie's body in their minds and fantasies even after she has passed by and is no longer visible to them. What they 'lose' with the eye (the actual sight of her as she walks away) they 'save' with the mind (the mental image they retain for later pleasure or fantasy). This stands in contrast to the women on the porch, who instead notice her faded shirt and muddy overalls, storing these details as potential ammunition to use against Janie later, hoping she might 'fall to their level some day.'",
  "quote": "The men noticed her firm buttocks like she had grapefruits in her hip pockets; the great rope of black hair swinging to her waist and unraveling in the wind like a plume; then her pugnacious breasts trying to bore holes in her shirt. They, the men, were saving with the mind what they lost with the eye.",
