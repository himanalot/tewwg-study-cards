  "question": "Why did Tea Cake go to Jacksonville?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake went to Jacksonville for two reasons: to get a job at the railroad shops where he had worked before (his old boss had promised him work), and to marry Janie. He had previously worked in the railroad shops there and his former boss promised him a job when the next pay day came. He wrote to Janie telling her to come to Jacksonville so he could marry her right from the train station.",
  "quote": "Jacksonville. Tea Cake's letter had said Jacksonville. He had worked in the railroad shops up there before and his old boss had promised him a job come next pay day. No need for Janie to wait any longer. Wear the new blue dress because he meant to marry her right from the train.",
