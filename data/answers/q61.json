  "question": "What reason does Tea Cake give Janie for stealing her $200? What did he spend the money on?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake explains that he took the money out of curiosity while tying his tie and, upon discovering how much it was, he wanted to feel like a millionaire and let people know who he was. He had never had his hand on so much money before. He spent the $200 on throwing a lavish free chicken and macaroni supper for railroad workers in Callahan, complete with fried chicken, biscuits, and a washtub full of macaroni with cheese. He also hired a guitar player so people could dance, paid ugly women not to come in (including $5 to one particularly ugly woman), and bought himself a new guitar for $15. By the time the party ended, he had only $12 left.",
  "quote": "He never had had his hand on so much money before in his life, so he made up his mind to see how it felt to be a millionaire. They went on out to Callahan round the railroad shops and he decided to give a big chicken and macaroni supper that night, free to all... A big table loaded down with fried chicken and biscuits and a wash-tub full of macaroni with plenty cheese in it... And he stood in the door and paid all the ugly women two dollars not to come in. One big meriny colored woman was so ugly till it was worth five dollars for her not to come in, so he gave it to her.",
