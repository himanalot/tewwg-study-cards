  "question": "What is a 'boogerboo' and what did Tea Cake do to him/it?",
  "answer": "A 'boogerboo' is a slang term used to describe a troublemaker or someone who is causing problems. In the novel, the term refers to a rude, aggressive man who showed up at Tea Cake's party and started causing trouble by trying to take all the best pieces of chicken (the livers and gizzards) for himself, refusing to let anyone else serve him. When nobody else could calm him down, Tea Cake confronted him and challenged him to a fight. Tea Cake knocked out two of the man's teeth, and the boogerboo left the party after that.",
  "quote": "So they all went outside to see if Tea Cake could handle the boogerboo. Tea Cake knocked out two of his teeth, so that man went on off from there.",
