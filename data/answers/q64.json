  "question": "How did Tea Cake wind up being cut by a man with a switch blade?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake was cut while gambling on payday in Jacksonville. He won all the money in the dice game, including cleaning out a man called Double-Ugly. When Tea Cake tried to leave around 4 o'clock in the morning with his winnings, Double-Ugly accused him of switching the dice. As Tea Cake reached the door with his hat on and one arm in his coat, Double-Ugly jumped at him from behind and cut him twice in the back with a razor (not a switch blade). Tea Cake then grabbed Double-Ugly by his necktie and overpowered him, causing Double-Ugly to lose his razor while trying to get free. Tea Cake left Double-Ugly on the doorstep and made his way home to Janie. Notably, it was actually Double-Ugly who used a razor, while Tea Cake had bought a new switch-blade knife for protection before the game.",
