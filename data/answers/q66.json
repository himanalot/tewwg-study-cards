  "question": "What did they plan to do on the muck?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake and Janie planned to pick beans during the day and at night Tea Cake would play his guitar (pick his box) and gamble by rolling dice. Tea Cake also planned to plant beans when the season opened, working for the best boss-man on the muck. The Everglades around Clewiston and Belle Glade was where they raised cane, string-beans, and tomatoes, and Tea Cake saw it as an opportunity to make money.",
