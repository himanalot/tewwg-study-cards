  "question": "Why did Tea Cake try to get to the muck 'early'?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake wanted to arrive at the muck early for two main reasons: First, to secure a room at the hotel with a bath tub before the crowds arrived - since accommodations were extremely limited and would quickly fill up when the season opened. Second, and more importantly, to get a good picking job with the best boss-man before the other workers arrived. Tea Cake explains that while anyone can get jobs during the season, arriving early allows you to work with 'the right folks' - meaning the best employers who offer better working conditions.",

Before de rest of 'em gits heah. You can always git jobs round heah in de season, but not wid de right folks.",
