  "question": "What special skills or hobbies did Tea Cake teach Janie for the first time in her life?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake taught Janie several skills she had never learned before: how to play checkers, how to shoot (pistol, shotgun, and rifle), how to fish at night, and how to drive a car. Janie had been excluded from these activities during her marriage to Joe Starks, who believed such things were beneath her. Tea Cake not only taught her these skills but encouraged her participation, and Janie became so proficient at shooting that she eventually surpassed Tea Cake himself, able to shoot the head off a chicken-hawk in a pine tree.",
  "quote": "Every day they were practising. Tea Cake made her shoot at little things just to give her good aim. Pistol and shot gun and rifle. It got so the others stood around and watched them... And the thing that got everybody was the way Janie caught on. She got to the place she could shoot a hawk out of a pine tree and not tear him up. Shoot his head off. She got to be a better shot than Tea Cake.",
  "supporting_quotes": [
    "'Tell yuh whut, Janie, less buy us some shootin' tools and go huntin' round heah.' 'Dat would be fine, Tea Cake, exceptin' you know Ah can't shoot. But Ah'd love tuh go wid you.' 'Oh, you needs tuh learn how.'",
    "'How about playin' you some checkers? You looks hard tuh beat.' 'Ah is, 'cause Ah can't play uh lick.'... 'You reckon so? Jody useter tell me Ah never would learn. It wuz too heavy fuh mah brains.'",
    "'Moon's too pretty fuh anybody tuh be sleepin' it away,' Tea Cake said... 'Less us go fishin'.' 'Fishin'? Dis time uh night?'",
    "Tea Cake in a borrowed car teaching Janie to drive. Tea Cake and Janie playing checkers; playing coon-can; playing Florida flip on the store porch all afternoon as if nobody else was there."
