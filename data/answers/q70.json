  "question": "Who was Nunkie and why was she chunky?",
  "answer": "Nunkie was a young woman who worked in the bean fields on the muck in the Everglades alongside Janie and Tea Cake. She was described as 'a little chunky girl' who flirted aggressively with Tea Cake, trying to lure him away from Janie. She would playfully hit Tea Cake, contradict everything he said, and pretend to fall helplessly against him or onto the ground so he would have to pick her up. The word 'chunky' refers to her physical build - she was short and solidly built. Tea Cake later dismisses her as 'dat lil chunk of a woman,' reinforcing that she was small and stocky in stature compared to Janie. Nunkie's flirtation made Janie experience jealousy for the first time, ultimately leading to a confrontation when Janie found Tea Cake and Nunkie 'struggling' in the cane field.",
  "quote": "Janie learned what it felt like to be jealous. A little chunky girl took to picking a play out of Tea Cake in the fields and in the quarters.",
