  "question": "What kind of 'dances' did Janie and Tea Cake start to have or host in back of her house?",
  "answer": "Janie and Tea Cake hosted 'fire dances' behind their house. These were Bahaman dances featuring drummers, which they began hosting after befriending the Bahaman workers (called 'Saws') in the Everglades. The dances were held night after night, and Tea Cake and Janie stayed up so late at these fire dances that Tea Cake would not let Janie go with him to the field so she could get her rest.",
  "quote": "So they began to hold dances night after night in the quarters, usually behind Tea Cake's house. Often now, Tea Cake and Janie stayed up so late at the fire dances that Tea Cake would not let her go with him to the field. He wanted her to get her rest.",
