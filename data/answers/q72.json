  "question": "Why did Mrs. Turner speak so disparagingly about Booker T. Washington?",
  "answer": "Mrs. Turner spoke disparagingly about Booker T. Washington because of her deeply held colorist beliefs and worship of Caucasian characteristics. As a dark-skinned Black man, Washington represented the opposite of what she valued. She accused him of 'cutting the monkey for white folks' - meaning she believed he demeaned himself to gain white approval and was 'pomped up' by whites as a result. She also criticized his emphasis on work and manual labor, claiming 'He didn't do nothin' but hold us back—talkin' 'bout work when de race ain't never done nothin' else.' To Mrs. Turner, Washington was 'uh white folks' nigger' - an enemy to Black people because he didn't advance the cause of lighter-skinned, more 'white-featured' African Americans like herself. Her brother shared these views and reportedly 'tore him tuh pieces' in a paper at a Sunday School Convention.",
