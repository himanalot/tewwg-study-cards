  "question": "Why was Mrs. Turner especially attracted to Janie?",
  "answer": "Mrs. Turner was especially attracted to Janie because of Janie's light skin and Caucasian features. Mrs. Turner worshipped whiteness and had 'built an altar to the unattainable—Caucasian characteristics for all.' She valued Janie's 'coffee-and-cream complexion' and 'luxurious hair' because these features set Janie apart from darker-skinned Black people. Mrs. Turner 'paid homage to Janie's Caucasian characteristics as such,' and being around Janie gave her 'a feeling of transmutation, as if she herself had become whiter and with straighter hair.' Mrs. Turner's colorism and internalized racism made her seek out Janie specifically because Janie's lighter features aligned with Mrs. Turner's worship of whiteness.",
  "quote": "Janie's coffee-and-cream complexion and her luxurious hair made Mrs. Turner forgive her for wearing overalls like the other women who worked in the fields... So she didn't cling to Janie Woods the woman. She paid homage to Janie's Caucasian characteristics as such. And when she was with Janie she had a feeling of transmutation, as if she herself had become whiter and with straighter hair.",
