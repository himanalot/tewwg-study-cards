  "question": "According to the narrator, why did Mrs. Turner patiently endure mistreatment or cruelty from Janie?",
  "answer": "Mrs. Turner endured mistreatment from Janie because she worshipped Janie's Caucasian characteristics (her light skin, coffee-and-cream complexion, and luxurious hair) as if Janie were a deity. The narrator explains that Mrs. Turner had built an altar to whiteness and Caucasian features, and like all worshippers, she accepted cruelty from her deity. According to the narrator's philosophy, 'All gods who receive homage are cruel' and worshippers inevitably accept inconsistency and cruelty from their gods. Because Janie looked 'more white folkish' than Mrs. Turner, it was 'right that they should be cruel to her at times' in Mrs. Turner's worldview.",
  "quote": "She felt honored by Janie's acquaintance and she quickly forgave and forgot snubs in order to keep it. Anyone who looked more white folkish than herself was better than she was in her criteria, therefore it was right that they should be cruel to her at times, just as she was cruel to those more negroid than herself in direct ratio to their negroness. Like the pecking-order in a chicken yard. Insensate cruelty to those you can whip, and groveling submission to those you can't. Once having set up her idols and built altars to them it was inevitable that she would worship there. It was inevitable that she should accept any inconsistency and cruelty from her deity as all good worshippers do from theirs. All gods who receive homage are cruel. All gods dispense suffering without reason. Otherwise they would not be worshipped.",
