  "question": "Why did Tea Cake feel it was necessary to whip and slap Janie?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake beat Janie to assert his possession of her and to demonstrate his control to the Turners. When Mrs. Turner brought her brother to meet Janie, hoping to lure Janie away from Tea Cake, Tea Cake became jealous and fearful of losing her. He beat Janie not because she did anything wrong, but to relieve his own insecurity and to show Mrs. Turner and her brother that he was Janie's boss. As Tea Cake himself explains, he beat her 'tuh show dem Turners who is boss' after Mrs. Turner had been telling Janie that Tea Cake was 'too black' for her. The act was about reassuring himself of his possession of Janie and demonstrating dominance to those who were trying to interfere in their relationship.",
  "quote": "Before the week was over he had whipped Janie. Not because her behavior justified his jealousy, but it relieved that awful fear inside him. Being able to whip her reassured him in possession. No brutal beating at all. He just slapped her around a bit to show he was boss... 'Ah didn't whup Janie 'cause she done nothin'. Ah beat her tuh show dem Turners who is boss.'",
