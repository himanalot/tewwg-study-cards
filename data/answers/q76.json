  "question": "How did Tea Cake's friends react when they learned Tea Cake had beaten Janie?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake's friends reacted with envy and admiration when they learned he had beaten Janie. Both men and women in the fields talked about it the next day, and it 'aroused a sort of envy' in them. Sop-de-Bottom told Tea Cake he was 'a lucky man' because you could see every place he hit her and Janie didn't fight back. Sop envied Tea Cake for having such a 'tender woman' and expressed that he wished he could whip a woman like Janie, complaining that his own wife would fight back all night and no one could even tell he had hit her. The women admired how Tea Cake pampered Janie afterward, as if the slaps had 'nearly killed her,' and the men admired Janie's helpless devotion to Tea Cake.",
