  "question": "What circumstances led to the brawl at Mrs. Turner's?",
  "answer": "The brawl at Mrs. Turner's eating house was orchestrated by Tea Cake and his friends as retaliation against Mrs. Turner's colorism and her attempts to break up Tea Cake and Janie's marriage. Mrs. Turner, who worshipped 'Caucasian characteristics' and despised dark-skinned Black people, had sent for her lighter-skinned brother to 'bait Janie in and take her way' from Tea Cake. When Tea Cake learned of this scheme, he and Sop-de-Bottom and the other men decided to run Mrs. Turner off the muck. On Saturday night, after everyone got drunk on 'coon-dick,' Tea Cake and his friends gathered at Mrs. Turner's eating house. The staged fight began when Coodemay tried to take Sop-de-Bottom's chair. Sop resisted, coffee got spilled, and Sop threw a saucer at Coodemay but hit Bootyny instead. Bootyny threw a coffee cup back, and the fight escalated. Tea Cake pretended to restore order while actually making things worse, causing the destruction of Mrs. Turner's establishment with broken dishes, tables, chairs, and windows.",

So he aimed at Coodemay with a saucer and hit Bootyny. Bootyny threw his thick coffee cup at Coodemay and just missed Stew Beef. So it got to be a big fight.",
