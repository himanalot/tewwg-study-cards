  "question": "How did Tea Cake react when the brawl broke out?",
  "answer": "When the brawl broke out at Mrs. Turner's eating house, Tea Cake actively led and escalated the fight rather than trying to stop it. He grabbed Coodemay by the collar and insisted on throwing him out, claiming to defend Mrs. Turner's honor. Despite Mrs. Turner's pleas to leave the troublemakers alone, Tea Cake refused to stop, declaring he would show them they could not 'come runnin' over nice people.' He continued fighting until Coodemay finally admitted he was wrong. This was actually a calculated move - Tea Cake and his friends had secretly planned the brawl to wreck Mrs. Turner's restaurant and drive her out of business because she was 'color-struck' and had been trying to lure Janie away from Tea Cake with her lighter-skinned brother.",
