  "question": "What was Mrs. Turner's opinion of Tea Cake? Of Booker T. Washington?",
  "answer": "Mrs. Turner disapproved of Tea Cake because he was too dark-skinned. She could not understand why a light-skinned woman like Janie would marry 'a man as dark as Tea Cake' and told Janie she 'jus' couldn't see mahself married to no black man.' She believed lighter-skinned Black people should 'class off' from darker ones and wanted to introduce Janie to her lighter-skinned brother as a replacement for Tea Cake. Regarding Booker T. Washington, Mrs. Turner held him in contempt, calling him 'a white folks' nigger' who 'didn't do nothin' but hold us back.' She said 'All he ever done was cut de monkey for white folks' and boasted that her brother 'read uh paper on Booker T. Washington and tore him tuh pieces' at a Sunday School Convention. Mrs. Turner's views reflect her internalized racism and worship of 'Caucasian characteristics.'",

But you know whut de ole folks say 'de higher de monkey climbs de mo' he show his behind' so dat's de way it wuz wid Booker T... He didn't do nothin' but hold us back—talkin' 'bout work when de race ain't never done nothin' else. He wuz uh enemy tuh us, dat's whut. He wuz uh white folks' nigger.",
