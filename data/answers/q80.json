  "question": "Why did Mrs. Turner feel the way she did about Tea Cake?",
  "answer": "Mrs. Turner disliked Tea Cake primarily because of his dark skin color. As a colorist who worshipped Caucasian physical characteristics, Mrs. Turner believed that lighter-skinned Black people should 'class off' from darker-skinned ones. She viewed Tea Cake's darkness as a defilement of Janie, whom she admired for her 'coffee-and-cream complexion' and 'luxurious hair.' Mrs. Turner had built 'an altar to the unattainable - Caucasian characteristics for all' and saw Tea Cake as a 'desecrator' of this ideal. She believed Janie had married beneath herself and actively tried to replace Tea Cake with her own lighter-skinned brother. Additionally, she resented Tea Cake for mocking her beliefs, as he once told her not to 'make God look so foolish - findin' fault wid everything He made.'",
  "quote": "She didn't forgive her for marrying a man as dark as Tea Cake, but she felt that she could remedy that. That was what her brother was born for... Mrs. Turner, like all other believers had built an altar to the unattainable - Caucasian characteristics for all... she hated Tea Cake first for his defilement of divinity and next for his telling mockery of her.",
