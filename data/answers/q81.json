He was described as a larger-than-life figure, 'a man dat wuz more'n man,' who embodied strength, defiance, and supernatural abilities. According to the tales told by the 'flame-throwers' (storytellers), Big John de Conquer did everything big on earth, then went up to heaven without dying, played guitar for the angels around God's throne, won a flying race to Jericho against everyone except God and Old Peter, went down to hell, beat the devil, and passed out ice water to everyone there. He was also characterized as someone who 'wouldn't dig potatoes, and he wouldn't rake hay: He wouldn't take a whipping, and he wouldn't run away' - representing resistance to oppression and enslavement. The character represents the spirit of resilience and triumph in African American folklore.",
