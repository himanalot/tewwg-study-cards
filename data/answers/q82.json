  "question": "Explain the circumstances which led the narrator to say 'their eyes were watching God.' Whose eyes are intended?",
  "answer": "The title phrase appears during the devastating 1928 Okeechobee hurricane in Chapter 18. Janie and Tea Cake, along with Motor Boat and other migrant workers, are trapped in their flimsy shanty as the hurricane intensifies. Earlier, Seminole Indians had passed through warning of the coming storm ('Saw-grass bloom. Hurricane coming'), but the workers ignored them because they were making good money picking beans. When the hurricane finally strikes with full force, the wind comes back 'with triple fury' and extinguishes the light for the last time. In the darkness, the people huddle together, helpless against the overwhelming power of nature. The narrator describes how 'their eyes straining against crude walls and their souls asking if He meant to measure their puny might against His.' At this moment of existential crisis, when humans face the terrible power of nature and their own mortality, 'they seemed to be staring at the dark, but their eyes were watching God.' The 'eyes' belong to Janie, Tea Cake, and all the other migrant workers sheltering in shanties across the muck during the storm. Earlier in the scene, the narrator mentions 'Six eyes were questioning God,' referring specifically to Janie, Tea Cake, and Motor Boat. The phrase captures the moment when people, stripped of all pretense and facing death, look beyond the physical darkness to confront the divine - questioning whether God intends to test their insignificant human strength against His omnipotent power.",
