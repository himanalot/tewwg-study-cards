  "question": "How did Tea Cake acquire hydrophobia?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake acquired hydrophobia (rabies) when he was bitten by a rabid dog during the hurricane. While fleeing the rising floodwaters of Lake Okeechobee, Janie grabbed onto a swimming cow for support. A mad dog was riding on the cow's back and attacked Janie. Tea Cake dove into the water and fought the dog with his knife to save Janie. During the struggle, the dog bit Tea Cake high up on his cheekbone before Tea Cake killed it. The bite from the rabid dog infected Tea Cake with hydrophobia, which would later prove fatal.",
  "quote": "They fought and somehow he managed to bite Tea Cake high up on his cheek-bone once. Then Tea Cake finished him and sent him to the bottom to stay there... Janie began to fuss around his face where the dog had bitten him but he said it didn't amount to anything.",
