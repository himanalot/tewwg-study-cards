  "question": "Why was Tea Cake accosted by a white man with a rifle? What did this man force him to do?",
  "answer": "After the hurricane devastated the area, Tea Cake was accosted by two white men with rifles who were rounding up men to help bury the dead. There were so many corpses from the storm that authorities were pressing men into forced labor to clear the wreckage and bury bodies. When Tea Cake protested that he was a working man with money and had just been blown out of the Glades by the storm, the short man threatened him with his rifle, saying 'Don't look out somebody'll be buryin' you!' Tea Cake was forced to join a small army of men who had to search for bodies throughout the devastation - in wrecked houses, under houses, tangled in shrubbery, floating in water, and hanging in trees - and bury them. The scene also reveals the racial injustice of the time, as the guards ordered the workers to examine each body to determine if it was white or black, because white victims received pine coffins while black victims were simply covered with quickite and buried without ceremony.",
  "quote": "While Tea Cake was standing and looking he saw two men coming towards him with rifles on their shoulders. Two white men, so he thought about what Janie had told him and flexed his knees to run... 'Dat's whut we want yuh fuh—not doin' nothin'. Come on less go bury some uh dese heah dead folks. Dey ain't gittin' buried fast enough.'... The short man made a quick move with his rifle. 'Git on down de road dere, suh! Don't look out somebody'll be buryin' you! G'wan in front uh me, suh!' Tea Cake found that he was part of a small army that had been pressed into service to clear the wreckage in public places and bury the dead.",
