  "question": "Explain how Tea Cake died.",
  "answer": "Tea Cake died after being shot by Janie in self-defense. During the hurricane in Chapter 18, Tea Cake saved Janie from a rabid dog that was attacking her while she clung to a swimming cow. In the struggle, the mad dog bit Tea Cake on his cheek. Weeks later, Tea Cake began showing symptoms of rabies - he couldn't swallow water, became paranoid and delusional, and accused Janie of infidelity. The doctor confirmed it was rabies and that it was too late for treatment. In his final rabid madness in Chapter 19, Tea Cake threatened Janie with a pistol, believing she had betrayed him. Janie had prepared a rifle for protection and rotated the pistol's cylinder so it would click three times before firing. When Tea Cake leveled his pistol at her and pulled the trigger, Janie fired her rifle just as his pistol discharged. Her bullet struck his heart while his bullet missed, burying itself in the joist above her head. Tea Cake fell forward into her arms and bit her forearm before dying. Janie was tried for his murder the same day but was acquitted when the jury ruled his death 'entirely accidental and justifiable.'",
  "quote": "The pistol and the rifle rang out almost together. The pistol just enough after the rifle to seem its echo. Tea Cake crumpled as his bullet buried itself in the joist over Janie's head. Janie saw the look on his face and leaped forward as he crashed forward in her arms.",
