  "question": "Describe how the Black community behaved during Janie's trial.",
  "answer": "The Black community was hostile and united against Janie during her trial. They packed into the back of the courtroom, standing 'tight like a case of celery,' and were unanimous in their belief that Janie had wronged Tea Cake. They believed Tea Cake had been a devoted husband who worked hard for Janie and nearly died saving her in the storm, but that she had betrayed him by taking up with another man when he got sick. They wanted to testify against her and felt 'hanging was too good' for her. They 'pelted her with dirty thoughts' and had their 'tongues cocked and loaded' as their only weapon in the presence of white folks. They moved and talked together 'like a choir' in what Hurston calls a 'tongue storm' and a 'palm tree dance.' When Sop-de-Bottom tried to speak out against Janie, he was silenced by the prosecutor. After Janie was acquitted and the white women surrounded her protectively, the Black community 'with heads hung down, shuffled out and away.'",
  "quote": "Then she saw all of the colored people standing up in the back of the courtroom. Packed tight like a case of celery, only much darker than that. They were all against her, she could see. So many were there against her that a light slap from each one of them would have beat her to death. She felt them pelting her with dirty thoughts. They were there with their tongues cocked and loaded, the only real weapon left to weak folks. The only killing tool they are allowed to use in the presence of white folks.",
