  "question": "Describe how the white community behaved during Janie's trial.",
  "answer": "The white community behaved sympathetically toward Janie during her trial, ultimately acquitting her. Eight or ten well-dressed white women attended the trial, and Janie noted 'they didn't seem too mad.' During the proceedings, when Mr. Prescott silenced the hostile Black crowd who wanted to testify against Janie, the white women 'made a little applause.' After Janie testified and the all-white jury deliberated for only five minutes, they found that Tea Cake's death was 'entirely accidental and justifiable' with 'no blame' on Janie. Following the acquittal, the judge and others 'smiled with her and shook her hand,' while the white women 'cried and stood around her like a protecting wall.' This stood in stark contrast to the Black community, who had come to testify against Janie and 'shuffled out and away' with 'heads hung down' after the verdict. Janie then visited her 'kind white friends who had realized her feelings' to thank them. The novel also includes a cynical interpretation from Black men at a boarding house who suggest the white community's sympathy stemmed from racism: 'She didn't kill no white man, did she? Well, long as she don't shoot no white man she kin kill jus' as many niggers as she please.'",
  "quote": "So she was free and the judge and everybody up there smiled with her and shook her hand. And the white women cried and stood around her like a protecting wall and the Negroes, with heads hung down, shuffled out and away.",
