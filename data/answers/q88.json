  "question": "What kind of funeral was held for Tea Cake?",
  "answer": "Tea Cake had an elaborate, loving funeral in West Palm Beach. Janie spared no expense, having a strong vault built in the cemetery to keep him safe from storms. The Undertaker did a handsome job, and Tea Cake lay on a white silken couch surrounded by roses. Janie bought him a brand new guitar and placed it in his hands. Sop and Tea Cake's friends from the muck came with shame and apology, filling ten sedans that Janie had hired plus more. A band played, and Tea Cake 'rode like a Pharaoh to his tomb.' Unlike Joe Starks's funeral where Janie wore expensive black veils, she attended in her overalls, 'too busy feeling grief to dress like grief.'",
  "quote": "Janie buried Tea Cake in Palm Beach... She wanted him out of the way of storms, so she had a strong vault built in the cemetery at West Palm Beach. Janie had wired to Orlando for money to put him away. Tea Cake was the son of Evening Sun, and nothing was too good. The Undertaker did a handsome job and Tea Cake slept royally on his white silken couch among the roses she had bought. He looked almost ready to grin. Janie bought him a brand new guitar and put it in his hands... So the day of the funeral they came with shame and apology in their faces... So they filled up and overflowed the ten sedans that Janie had hired and added others to the line. Then the band played, and Tea Cake rode like a Pharaoh to his tomb. No expensive veils and robes for Janie this time. She went on in her overalls. She was too busy feeling grief to dress like grief.",
