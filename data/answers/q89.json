  "question": "How did Janie respond to the cruelty from Sop de Bottom and Tea Cake's other friends?",
  "answer": "Janie responded to the cruelty from Sop-de-Bottom and Tea Cake's other friends with understanding and forgiveness. Rather than holding a grudge against them for their hostile behavior during and after the trial, she recognized that their cruelty stemmed from their love for Tea Cake and their inability to understand what had happened. She chose to reach out to them, sending word to Sop and through him to all the others. Her gracious response brought them to the funeral with 'shame and apology in their faces,' and they wanted her forgiveness. They filled up the ten sedans she had hired for the funeral procession, demonstrating that her compassionate response had reconciled them.",
  "quote": "Sop and his friends had tried to hurt her but she knew it was because they loved Tea Cake and didn't understand. So she sent Sop word and to all the others through him. So the day of the funeral they came with shame and apology in their faces. They wanted her quick forgetfulness.",
