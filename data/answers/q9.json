  "question": "What is the 'muck'?",
  "answer": "The muck is the rich, fertile black soil region in the Florida Everglades, specifically around Lake Okeechobee near the towns of Clewiston and Belle Glade. It is an agricultural area where migrant workers come to pick beans, sugar cane, and tomatoes during the harvest season. Tea Cake takes Janie to the muck after they leave Eatonville, and they work there as bean pickers. The muck represents a place of hard work but also freedom, community, and equality - where Janie can work alongside Tea Cake and participate in the vibrant social life of the workers. The area is characterized by its extremely fertile ground ('Ground so rich that everything went wild'), big vegetation, and proximity to Lake Okeechobee. It becomes a site of both joy and tragedy in the novel, as this is where the devastating hurricane strikes and where Tea Cake is bitten by a rabid dog.",
