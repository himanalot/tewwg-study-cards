  "question": "At the end of the novel, what is Janie's attitude toward(s) the town gossips of Eatonville?",
  "answer": "Janie displays compassionate indifference toward the town gossips. Rather than feeling anger or resentment, she pities them for their limited understanding of life. She calls them 'meatskins' who 'got tuh rattle tuh make out they's alive' and says they are 'parched up from not knowin' things.' She dismissively tells Pheoby to 'let 'em consolate theyselves wid talk' because 'talkin' don't amount tuh uh hill uh beans when yuh can't do nothin' else.' Janie has achieved inner peace through her life experiences, having 'been tuh de horizon and back,' and no longer needs the validation or approval of the gossips. She views their talk as meaningless because they haven't truly lived - 'you got tuh go there tuh know there.'",
  "quote": "Now, Pheoby, don't feel too mean wid de rest of 'em 'cause dey's parched up from not knowin' things. Dem meatskins is got tuh rattle tuh make out they's alive. Let 'em consolate theyselves wid talk. 'Course, talkin' don't amount tuh uh hill uh beans when yuh can't do nothin' else.",
