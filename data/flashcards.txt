Q: Why and how did Johnny Taylor upset Nanny?

A: Her kiss with Johnny Taylor at the gatepost, following her sensual awakening under the pear tree. The narrator explicitly states: "That was the end of her childhood."

Q: What does "The vision of Logan Killicks was desecrating the pear tree" mean?

A: The black woman - she bears the burden passed down from white men to black men and finally to her.

Q: Why did Janie compare Joe to Lincoln and Washington?
A: After he bought Matt Bonner's mistreated mule for $5 and freed it. She said just as Lincoln freed enslaved people, Joe freed a mule - having power to free things makes him "lak uh king."
