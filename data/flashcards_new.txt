Q: According to Hurston in the opening paragraphs of the novel, how do men treat their dreams in contrast to women?
A: According to Hurston, men passively watch their dreams from a distance, waiting for them to come in 'with the tide' like ships on the horizon. For some men, their dreams never arrive - they 'sail forever on the horizon' until the man gives up waiting and his 'dreams mocked to death by Time.' Men are portrayed as passive watchers who eventually resign themselves to unfulfilled dreams. In contrast, women actively engage with their dreams. Women 'forget all those things they don't want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to forget.' For women, 'The dream is the truth' - they embrace their dreams as reality and 'act and do things accordingly.' Women take action based on their dreams rather than waiting for them to arrive.

Q: In the beginning of the novel, Janie has just returned from doing what?
A: Burying the dead - specifically, she has returned from burying Tea Cake in the Everglades after he died from rabies following the hurricane.

Q: What kind of clothing is Janie wearing at the beginning of the novel?
A: Janie is wearing a faded shirt and muddy overalls when she returns to Eatonville at the beginning of the novel. This working-class attire is notable because it contrasts with her previous status as the wealthy widow of Joe Starks, and the townswomen on the porch take note of her clothing as potential evidence of her fall from grace.

Q: How is Janie wearing her hair?
A: Janie is wearing her hair down, swinging to her waist. It is described as a 'great rope of black hair' that is loose and unraveling in the wind like a plume, rather than tied up or covered as would be expected of a respectable older woman of that era.

Q: What are the details mentioned in the answers to questions 4 and 5 intended to suggest about Janie's character?
A: The details about Janie's appearance - her muddy overalls and loose hair swinging down her back - are intended to suggest several key aspects of her character: (1) Independence and defiance: By wearing overalls instead of a proper dress and letting her hair hang loose like 'some young gal,' Janie rejects the social conventions expected of a respectable widow and former mayor's wife. The townspeople's outraged questions ('What she doin coming back here in dem overhalls? Can't she find no dress to put on?') reveal how her appearance defies their expectations. (2) Sexuality and vitality: The narrator's description of Janie through the men's eyes emphasizes her physical presence - her 'firm buttocks,' the 'great rope of black hair swinging to her waist,' and her 'pugnacious breasts trying to bore holes in her shirt.' These details suggest an unapologetic sensuality and physical confidence. (3) Strength and self-possession: The text explicitly states the overalls were 'a weapon against her strength' that the women hoped to use against her. Janie's refusal to dress in grief or conform to expectations demonstrates her inner strength. (4) Class transcendence: By wearing working-class clothing, Janie shows she has moved beyond concern for status and wealth, having found something more valuable in her journey with Tea Cake. The envy the townspeople feel ('Seeing the woman as she was made them remember the envy they had stored up from other times') confirms that Janie possesses something they lack - authentic self-realization.

Q: What does Hurston mean at the beginning of the chapter when she says the men of Eatonville were 'saving with the mind what they lost with the eye'?
A: Hurston means that as Janie walks past the men on the porch, they are mentally storing and memorizing the visual details of her physical appearance - particularly her attractive features like her 'firm buttocks,' her long black hair 'swinging to her waist,' and her 'pugnacious breasts' - because they know she will soon be out of their sight. The phrase captures the men's lustful gaze and their desire to hold onto the image of Janie's body in their minds and fantasies even after she has passed by and is no longer visible to them. What they 'lose' with the eye (the actual sight of her as she walks away) they 'save' with the mind (the mental image they retain for later pleasure or fantasy). This stands in contrast to the women on the porch, who instead notice her faded shirt and muddy overalls, storing these details as potential ammunition to use against Janie later, hoping she might 'fall to their level some day.'

Q: According to Sam Watson, why do many of the people of Eatonville look forward to the Day of Judgment?
A: According to Sam Watson, many people in Eatonville look forward to the Day of Judgment because they want to hear all the secrets that will be revealed. They are so curious and nosy about other people's business that they go to church to ensure they will rise on Judgment Day when every secret is supposed to be made known. They want to be there to hear it all.

Q: According to Hurston, what is the oldest human longing?
A: Self-revelation. Hurston identifies the oldest human longing as the desire to reveal oneself, to tell one's own story to another person who will listen and understand.

Q: What is the 'muck'?
A: The muck is the rich, fertile black soil region in the Florida Everglades, specifically around Lake Okeechobee near the towns of Clewiston and Belle Glade. It is an agricultural area where migrant workers come to pick beans, sugar cane, and tomatoes during the harvest season. Tea Cake takes Janie to the muck after they leave Eatonville, and they work there as bean pickers. The muck represents a place of hard work but also freedom, community, and equality - where Janie can work alongside Tea Cake and participate in the vibrant social life of the workers. The area is characterized by its extremely fertile ground ('Ground so rich that everything went wild'), big vegetation, and proximity to Lake Okeechobee. It becomes a site of both joy and tragedy in the novel, as this is where the devastating hurricane strikes and where Tea Cake is bitten by a rabid dog.

Q: In what kind of family was Janie raised?
A: Janie was raised by her grandmother Nanny in the backyard of a white family named Washburn in West Florida. Janie never knew her parents - her father was absent and her mother left when Janie was very young. Nanny worked for the Washburns, who were 'quality white folks,' and had a small house in their backyard where Janie was born and raised. Janie grew up playing with the four white Washburn grandchildren and was treated so similarly to them that she didn't realize she was Black until age six when a photograph revealed her difference. Mrs. Washburn dressed Janie in the Washburn children's hand-me-down clothes and put ribbons in her hair. Eventually, after Janie was teased at school for living in the white folks' backyard, Nanny got her own land and house, with Mrs. Washburn helping considerably with the move.

Q: Why did Janie believe she was white?
A: Janie believed she was white because she grew up on the Washburn property where her grandmother Nanny worked. She was raised alongside the Washburn grandchildren and played with them constantly from birth. Because she spent all her time with the white children and was treated the same as them by both Nanny and Mrs. Washburn, she had no awareness that she was racially different from them. She only discovered she was Black at around six years old when a traveling photographer took a group picture of all the children, and when she looked at it, she couldn't recognize herself as the dark-skinned child in the photo, asking 'where is me?' until Miss Nellie pointed out that she was the dark one, leading to her exclamation 'Aw, aw! Ah'm colored!'

Q: How did Janie learn for the first time in her life that she was not white?
A: Janie learned she was not white when she was around six years old through a group photograph. A man came by the Washburn property taking pictures, and Shelby (the oldest white boy) told him to photograph all the children together. When the photograph came back about a week later, everyone was pointed out in the picture except for 'a real dark little girl with long hair standing by Eleanor.' Janie could not recognize herself as that dark child and asked 'where is me?' Miss Nellie pointed to the dark girl and said 'Dat's you, Alphabet, don't you know yo' ownself?' (They called Janie 'Alphabet' because so many people had given her different names.) After looking at the picture for a long time and recognizing her dress and hair, Janie exclaimed 'Aw, aw! Ah'm colored!' - realizing for the first time that she was different from the white children she had grown up with.

Q: Why and how did Johnny Taylor upset Nanny?
A: Johnny Taylor upset Nanny by kissing Janie over the front gatepost. Nanny woke from her sleep to see Johnny Taylor kissing her granddaughter, which horrified her. Nanny viewed Johnny Taylor as 'trashy' and 'shiftless' - a poor, worthless man ('breath-and-britches') who was not good enough for Janie. This kiss represented Janie's transition into womanhood and sexuality, which frightened Nanny because she feared Janie would be exploited by men like Johnny Taylor. The incident prompted Nanny to immediately arrange Janie's marriage to Logan Killicks, a respectable older man with property, to protect Janie from such unsuitable suitors.

Q: What specific episode marked the end of Janie's childhood?
A: The specific episode that marked the end of Janie's childhood was her kiss with Johnny Taylor at the gatepost. This kiss occurred after Janie's transformative experience under the blossoming pear tree, where she witnessed the bees pollinating the blooms and had a sexual and spiritual awakening about love and marriage. In a state of heightened awareness and longing, she went to the front gate where she saw Johnny Taylor approaching. When Nanny caught them kissing, she called Janie inside, and the narrator explicitly states: 'That was the end of her childhood.' This moment triggered Nanny's decision to marry Janie off to Logan Killicks for protection and security.

Q: Why did Nanny favor Logan Killicks over Johnny Taylor?
A: Nanny favored Logan Killicks over Johnny Taylor primarily because Logan offered security, protection, and material stability that Johnny Taylor could not provide. Nanny dismisses Johnny Taylor as a 'trashy nigger' and 'breath-and-britches' (someone with nothing but the clothes on his back), viewing him as someone who would only use Janie. In contrast, Logan Killicks is described as 'a good man' who owns a house 'bought and paid for' and 'sixty acres uh land right on de big road.' Nanny's deeper motivation stems from her experiences in slavery and her fear that without protection, Janie would become 'de mule uh de world' like other Black women. She explicitly tells Janie that what she wants for her is not Logan Killicks himself, but 'protection.' As an elderly woman who knows she will die soon, Nanny wants to see Janie 'safe in life' before she passes, protected from being 'kicked around from pillar tuh post.' Logan's property and stability represent safety and dignity that Nanny never had as a slave, while Johnny Taylor represents the vulnerability and exploitation she fears for her granddaughter.

Q: What does the narrator mean when she says 'The vision of Logan Killicks was desecrating the pear tree'?
A: The pear tree represents Janie's idealized vision of love and marriage, which she develops at sixteen while lying beneath a blossoming pear tree in her grandmother's backyard. Watching the bees pollinate the flowers, she experiences a spiritual and sensual awakening, seeing the tree's blooming as a metaphor for perfect, harmonious union: 'She saw a dust-bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand sister-calyxes arch to meet the love embrace and the ecstatic shiver of the tree from root to tiniest branch creaming in every blossom and frothing with delight. So this was a marriage!' For Janie, the pear tree symbolizes passionate, mutual, organic love. When Nanny proposes that Janie marry Logan Killicks, the 'vision' of him 'desecrates' (profanes, violates, defiles) the pear tree because Logan represents the opposite of everything the tree means to Janie. He is old, unattractive, practical, and unromantic. The marriage Nanny offers is based on security and property (his 'often-mentioned sixty acres') rather than love. Logan cannot be the 'bee to her blossom.' The word 'desecrating' is particularly powerful because it suggests that Janie's dream of love is sacred to her, and the prospect of Logan Killicks as a husband is a sacrilege against that sacred ideal. Janie cannot articulate this to Nanny because Nanny's values prioritize protection and material security over romantic fulfillment, so 'Janie didn't know how to tell Nanny that. She merely hunched over and pouted at the floor.'

Q: Why did Nanny violently slap Janie's face?
A: Nanny slapped Janie because she caught Janie kissing Johnny Taylor at the gate, and when Nanny confronted her about it and insisted she must marry Logan Killicks for protection, Janie pouted and refused to respond. Nanny was frustrated by Janie's defiant silence and her fear that Janie would end up like her mother (who had been raped). Nanny saw the kiss as a sign that Janie had reached womanhood and was vulnerable to being taken advantage of by 'trashy' men. When Janie hunched over and pouted at the floor instead of answering, Nanny slapped her to force Janie to look at her and understand the seriousness of the situation.

Q: According to Nanny, who or what is the 'mule uh de world'?
A: According to Nanny, the black woman (specifically 'de nigger woman') is the 'mule uh de world.' Nanny explains this metaphor to Janie by describing a hierarchy of oppression: the white man is the ruler who throws down the load, the black man picks it up but passes it on to black women, making black women the ultimate burden-bearers of society - like mules who carry everyone's loads.

Q: Why does Nanny claim that the black woman is the 'mule uh the world'?
A: Nanny explains that the black woman is 'de mule uh de world' because she bears the burden that is passed down through a hierarchy of oppression. According to Nanny, the white man is 'de ruler of everything' and when he has a load to carry, he throws it down and tells the black man to pick it up. The black man picks it up because he has to, but he doesn't carry it himself - instead, he hands it to his womenfolks. Thus, the black woman ends up at the bottom of this chain, carrying the burdens that have been passed down from white men to black men and finally to her. Like a mule, she is forced to bear the heaviest loads while having the least power. Nanny shares this painful observation with Janie because she has been praying for Janie's life to be different from this pattern of exploitation.

Q: How does Nanny's background and history lead her to respect and admire somebody like Logan Killicks?
A: Nanny's traumatic experiences during slavery fundamentally shape her values and lead her to admire Logan Killicks for his material security rather than romantic qualities. Born into slavery, Nanny was sexually exploited by her master, resulting in a mixed-race daughter (Leafy). When the mistress discovered the baby's light features, she threatened to have Nanny whipped with one hundred lashes and sell the child. Nanny fled into the swamp, hiding among snakes and panthers to protect her baby until freedom came. These harrowing experiences taught Nanny that for Black women, survival and protection are paramount - she describes Black women as 'de mule uh de world.' After freedom, her daughter Leafy was raped by a schoolteacher, reinforcing Nanny's belief that Black women need male protection and material security. Logan Killicks represents everything Nanny never had: sixty acres of land, a house 'bought and paid for,' respectability (people must 'tip dey hat' and call Janie 'Mis' Killicks'), and the ability to provide protection. For Nanny, who was 'used for a work-ox and a brood-sow,' Logan's property and stability symbolize freedom from exploitation. When Janie complains about not loving Logan, Nanny dismisses love as 'de very prong all us black women gits hung on' - a luxury that leads to suffering. Nanny's definition of a 'good life' is sitting on a porch like white women did, having security, and being protected from abuse - not romantic fulfillment.

Q: Why was Nanny whipped when she was younger?
A: Nanny was threatened with whipping because her baby (Leafy) was fathered by the master of the plantation. When the mistress saw that Nanny's baby had gray eyes and yellow hair - clear evidence that the baby was mixed race and fathered by her husband - she became enraged. The mistress slapped Nanny and threatened to have her taken to the whipping post the next morning for one hundred lashes. Nanny escaped that night with her baby to the swamp to avoid the punishment.

Q: How was Janie conceived?
A: Janie was conceived when her mother Leafy, who was only seventeen years old, was raped by her school teacher. Nanny (Janie's grandmother) had been raising Leafy and had put her in school with hopes of making her a school teacher. One day Leafy didn't come home, and the next morning she came crawling back on her hands and knees after the school teacher had hidden her in the woods all night and raped her. By the time Leafy recovered, they knew she was pregnant with Janie. After Janie was born, Leafy took to drinking and staying out at night, eventually abandoning Janie to be raised by Nanny.

Q: What were Nanny's final words before she died?
A: Nanny's final words were a prayer spoken towards morning after spending all night on her knees in her shack. She muttered: 'Lawd, you know mah heart. Ah done de best Ah could do. De rest is left to you.' After speaking these words, she scuffled up from her knees and fell heavily across the bed. A month later she was dead. These words express her surrender to God after doing everything she could to protect Janie, acknowledging that her work was done and the rest was in God's hands.

Q: How did Janie react to the physical appearance of Logan Killicks?
A: Janie reacted with visceral disgust to Logan Killicks' physical appearance. When Nanny first tells her about Logan's marriage proposal, Janie immediately rejects him by comparing him to a skull in a graveyard. Later, in a conversation with Nanny after the marriage, Janie provides a detailed catalog of her physical revulsion: she hates the shape of his head (long one way and flat on the sides), the fat on his neck, his big belly, and his toenails that look like mule feet. She is also repulsed by his lack of hygiene, noting that he doesn't wash his feet before coming to bed despite her placing the water for him. Janie says she would rather be 'shot with tacks' than turn over in bed and stir up the air while he is there. The vision of Logan 'desecrated' her romantic vision of the pear tree, symbolizing how his unromantic, unpleasant appearance destroyed her idealistic dreams of love and marriage.

Q: Under what circumstances did Janie first come to meet Jody?
A: Janie first met Joe Starks (Jody) while she was still married to Logan Killicks. Logan had gone to buy a mule, leaving Janie at home cutting up seed potatoes. Janie moved outside to sit under an oak tree in the yard where she could see the road. A stylish, citified man came walking down the road whistling. Janie ran to the pump and jerked the handle hard to make noise and attract his attention, which also made her long hair fall down. Joe stopped and asked her for a cool drink of water. They began talking, and he introduced himself as Joe Starks from Georgia. He told her about his plans to go to the new all-black town being built in Florida where he hoped to become a big voice. When he learned she was married and expected to plow behind a mule, he told her she deserved better - to sit on a front porch and be treated like a lady. They continued meeting secretly in the scrub oaks across the road over the following days until Janie eventually decided to leave Logan and run away with Jody.

Q: How did Janie silence Hicks the first time he tried to flirt with her?
A: When Hicks attempted to flirt with Janie while Joe was away, he tried to engage her in conversation but Janie gave him only short, dismissive responses ('Ah reckon so,' 'Much obliged'). When Hicks grew frustrated and sarcastically remarked 'Folks must be mighty close-mouthed where you come from,' Janie silenced him with a clever retort: 'Dat's right. But it must be different at yo' home.' This witty comeback turned his insult back on him, implying he came from a place where people were too talkative or forward. Hicks was left speechless and eventually stumbled away with a surly goodbye.

Q: What item did Joe Starks buy from Sears and Roebuck that helped advance his fame in the town of Eatonville?
A: Joe Starks bought a street lamp from Sears, Roebuck and Company. This was the first street lamp in a colored town, and Joe made it into a major event by organizing a lamplighting ceremony with a barbecue feast, inviting people from all around Orange County. The lamp became a source of pride for the whole town and enhanced Joe's reputation as a progressive leader.

Q: What did Joe Starks' house look like?
A: Joe Starks' house was a grand two-story building with porches and bannisters, painted a 'gloaty, sparkly white.' It was so impressive compared to the other homes in Eatonville that the rest of the town looked like 'servants' quarters surrounding the big house.' The white paint was compared to the elegant homes of wealthy white people like Bishop Whipple, W. B. Jackson, and the Vanderpools. Joe waited until the house was completely painted inside and out before moving in, setting himself apart from the other residents. The house symbolized Joe's ambition and desire to emulate the power and status of white landowners, essentially making himself the 'big massa' of the all-Black town.

Q: What special item did Joe buy for Janie that made other people feel that Joe had taken advantage of them?
A: Joe bought Janie a little lady-size spittoon (spitting pot) decorated with little sprigs of flowers painted all around the sides. This fancy item made the townspeople feel taken advantage of because they had been spitting in tomato cans, not knowing that 'up-to-date folks' used such elegant flowered spittoons. It made them feel like things had been kept from them.

Q: Why did Joe make Henry Pitts leave town?
A: Joe Starks caught Henry Pitts stealing a wagon load of his ribbon cane (sugarcane). Joe confiscated the stolen cane and banished Henry Pitts from the town. Some townspeople thought Joe was too harsh, given how much cane and property he already had, but they only voiced these opinions when Joe wasn't around to hear them.

Q: Why did the citizens of Eatonville frequently make fun of Matt Bonner?
A: The citizens of Eatonville frequently made fun of Matt Bonner because of his skinny, mistreated yellow mule. The mule was so emaciated that the townspeople joked about women using its rib bones as a washboard and hanging things on its hock-bones to dry. They teased Matt relentlessly about not feeding the mule properly, with Sam, Lige, and Walter being the ringleaders of the 'mule-talkers.' The mule became the second most prominent topic of conversation in town after Mayor Starks himself, and provided endless entertainment for the porch-sitters at the store.

Q: What did Joe force Janie to wear while she worked in the store?
A: Joe forced Janie to wear a head rag (also called a head kerchief) to cover and tie up her hair while she worked in the store. He was jealous of the attention other men paid to Janie's beautiful, long hair and wanted to hide it from their view.

Q: Why did he make her wear this?
A: Joe (Jody) made Janie wear a head-rag in the store because he was intensely jealous of her beautiful long hair attracting other men's attention. He had observed other men 'figuratively wallowing' in her hair as she went about the store, and one night he caught Walter standing behind Janie, secretly brushing his hand back and forth across her braid to feel it. This enraged Joe so much he wanted to chop off Walter's hand with a meat knife. That night, he ordered Janie to tie up her hair. Joe wanted Janie to be 'there in the store for him to look at, not those others,' but his possessiveness and jealousy prevented him from ever explaining his true reasons to her.

Q: Why did Janie once compare her husband to Abe Lincoln and George Washington?
A: Janie compared Joe Starks to Abraham Lincoln and George Washington after he bought Matt Bonner's old, mistreated mule for five dollars and set it free, allowing it to live comfortably in town. She praised Joe publicly, saying that just as Lincoln freed the enslaved people because he had the power to rule the United States, Joe freed a mule because he had the power to rule his town. She told him that having the power to free things makes him 'lak uh king uh something.' This comparison elevated Joe's act of buying the mule's freedom to a heroic, presidential level of benevolence and authority.

Q: Why wouldn't Jody allow Janie to attend a mule's funeral?
A: Joe (Jody) refused to let Janie attend the mule's mock funeral (dragging-out) because he believed it was beneath her status as the Mayor's wife. He felt that she should not be seen mingling with common people in such a chaotic, undignified event. Joe was obsessed with class distinctions and propriety, and he saw the funeral as a gathering of 'no-manners' common folk engaging in 'commonness' that was unsuitable for someone of Janie's elevated social position. While Joe could attend because he was 'a man even if he is the Mayor,' he believed 'the mayor's wife is somethin' different again' and held her to a higher standard of public behavior. This reflects Joe's controlling nature and his view of Janie as a symbol of his status rather than as an individual with her own desires.

Q: Why did Jody strike Janie for the first time?
A: Jody struck Janie for the first time because she ruined dinner. The bread didn't rise, the fish wasn't quite done at the bone, and the rice was scorched. Joe had looked forward to his dinner as a refuge from other things, and when the meal turned out poorly, he slapped Janie until she had a ringing sound in her ears. This moment marks a significant turning point in their marriage, as Janie realizes that her idealized image of Jody has shattered. She was twenty-four years old and had been married for seven years when this incident occurred.

Q: What kind of ritual did Joe Starks go through with Mrs. Robbins?
A: Joe Starks went through a begging ritual with Mrs. Tony Robbins where she would come to his store and dramatically beg for meat, claiming she and her children were starving because her husband Tony 'don't fee-eed' her. Joe would pretend to be annoyed, then reluctantly agree to give her meat. He would cut a smaller piece than she requested, she would dramatically protest, and then when he pretended to put it back, she would quickly grab it and leave while complaining about his stinginess. This was a regular performance that entertained the porch sitters, and Tony had asked Joe to 'humor her along.'

Q: Approximately how old was Janie when she began to entertain the idea of running out on Joe?
A: Janie was approximately thirty-five years old when she began to entertain the idea of running out on Joe. The text notes that she 'considered flight' and reflected that 'thirty-five is twice seventeen and nothing was the same at all,' indicating her awareness of how much had changed since her youthful dreams at seventeen under the pear tree.

Q: How did Joe Starks change physically as he began to age?
A: As Joe Starks aged, his body underwent significant physical deterioration. He no longer sat down normally but fell into chairs. His knees weakened so that he no longer reared back confidently but squatted over his ankles when walking. His neck became stiff and still. His once-prominent, pugnacious belly that used to intimidate people began to sag like a suspended load, no longer appearing to be part of him. His eyes became absent and distant. As his condition worsened, his back ached constantly, his muscle dissolved into fat, and then the fat melted off his bones. Near his death, Janie could see through his thin counterpane what was left of his belly huddled before him on the bed like some helpless thing seeking shelter.

Q: What circumstances led Joe to strike Janie the second time -- the time that 'drove her from the store'?
A: The incident began when Steve Mixon asked for chewing tobacco and Janie cut the plug incorrectly. The tobacco knife was stiff and she fumbled with it, cutting 'way away from the mark.' Mixon held it up as a harmless joke, and the store crowd laughed good-naturedly. But Joe, who had been increasingly ridiculing Janie in public to deflect attention from his own declining health and aging body, did not laugh. He re-cut the tobacco and publicly humiliated Janie, mocking her inability to cut tobacco after years in the store and insulting her appearance by saying her 'rump hangin' nearly to yo' knees.' For the first time, Janie talked back publicly, telling Joe to stop mixing up her work with her looks. The confrontation escalated until Janie delivered a devastating blow to Joe's masculinity, declaring that when he pulls down his pants, he looks 'lak de change uh life.' This public emasculation in front of the men of Eatonville was unbearable to Joe. He felt she had 'robbed him of his illusion of irresistible maleness' and 'cast down his empty armor before men.' In response to this humiliation, Joe struck Janie with all his might and drove her from the store.

Q: Why did Joe start to see a 'root-doctor'?
A: Joe started seeing a root-doctor (also called a 'two-headed doctor') because he was dying from kidney failure but refused to accept a medical explanation for his illness. Despite having always been 'scornful of root-doctors,' Joe became desperate as his health declined. He believed that his sickness was caused by conjure or hoodoo - specifically that something had been 'buried against him' (a curse). The root-doctor also fed Joe's suspicions that Janie was poisoning him, which drove a further wedge between them. Rather than accepting medical treatment, Joe convinced himself that he would recover once the root-doctor found and removed the curse. This reflects both his denial about dying and his growing paranoia toward Janie in his final days.

Q: What rumors were the people of Eatonville spreading about Janie's treatment of her husband?
A: The people of Eatonville spread rumors that Janie had 'fixed' Joe Starks, meaning she had placed a voodoo curse or conjure spell on him to make him sick. Janie was accused of poisoning her husband. This rumor was started by a 'two-headed doctor' (a voodoo practitioner/root doctor) who was trying to gain Joe's trust and business by suggesting that his illness was caused by supernatural means rather than natural causes. The rumor spread through the town after the public confrontation between Janie and Joe in the store, when Janie humiliated him by insulting his manhood.

Q: Why did the word 'kidney' force Janie to think about death?
A: When the doctor from Orlando diagnosed Joe Starks with kidney failure, he told Janie that it was 'just a matter of time' because when a man's kidneys stop working altogether, there is no way for him to live. The doctor explained that Joe had needed medical attention two years earlier, but it was now too late. This terminal diagnosis forced Janie to confront the reality of Joe's impending death. The word 'kidney' became synonymous with a death sentence, triggering Janie's contemplation of Death as a personified figure - a strange being with huge square toes who lived in the West, standing watchful and motionless with his sword drawn back, waiting to claim Joe. The kidney diagnosis made death inevitable and immediate rather than abstract, forcing Janie to accept that she would soon find 'a feather from his wings lying in her yard.'

Q: According to Janie, what did Joe Starks always deny her the opportunity to use?
A: Her mind. Janie tells dying Joe that her own mind 'had tuh be squeezed and crowded out tuh make room for yours in me.' Joe denied Janie the opportunity to think for herself, speak her own thoughts, and express her own identity. He silenced her voice and suppressed her individuality throughout their marriage.

Q: What does Janie see in the looking glass at the end of chapter 8?
A: When Janie looks in the looking glass (mirror) at the end of Chapter 8, after Joe dies, she sees that the young girl she once was is gone, but a handsome woman has taken her place. She also lets down her hair and sees that its weight, length, and glory are still there. This moment represents Janie's self-rediscovery and liberation after years of suppression under Joe's control.

Q: Why do scores of men begin to offer their services to Janie at the beginning of chapter 9?
A: Men begin pursuing Janie at the beginning of Chapter 9 because she is now a wealthy, attractive widow. Her 'widowhood and property' represent a 'great challenge' to men in South Florida. She owns Joe Starks' store, collects rents from tenants, and has significant property - making her financially desirable. Additionally, she is described as 'too pretty for de mens tuh leave yuh alone' and 'too young uh 'oman tuh stay single.' The combination of her beauty and inherited wealth draws numerous suitors who drive 'considerable distances' to offer their services as advisors, though Janie sees through their pretenses, recognizing that 'most of the others were poor' women they knew, and these men were specifically targeting her because of her wealth.

Q: Who was Hezekiah and how did he treat Janie?
A: Hezekiah Potts was the seventeen-year-old delivery boy who worked at Joe Starks's store. After Joe's death, Hezekiah treated Janie like a 'baby-sister,' being protective and caring toward her. He tried to imitate Joe Starks in every way - smoking cigars, using Joe's expressions like 'I god,' sitting in Joe's swivel chair, and even trying to push out his belly to look like Joe's paunch. His 'sense of ownership' made him honest and reliable. When Tea Cake started showing interest in Janie, Hezekiah was protective, warning her that Tea Cake 'ain't got doodly squat' and offering to walk her home himself instead. Janie found his imitations of Joe amusing and appreciated his help running the store, noting she 'wouldn't know what to do without him.'

Q: What kind of relationship developed between Phoeby Watson, Janie, and the Sanford undertaker?
A: Pheoby Watson served as a go-between or matchmaker between Janie and a Sanford undertaker who was courting Janie after Joe Starks's death. The undertaker, a widower with a nice furnished home, was 'pressing his cause through Pheoby,' using her as an intermediary to pursue Janie romantically. Pheoby supported this match and tried to encourage Janie toward the undertaker, believing he was a safe, respectable choice who had property to match Janie's wealth. When Janie became involved with Tea Cake instead, Pheoby expressed disappointment and tried to convince Janie that the Sanford undertaker would be a better, more 'endurable' match. However, Janie showed no real romantic interest in the undertaker, merely 'listening pleasantly but undisturbed' to his advances through Pheoby.

Q: Who was Vergible Woods?
A: Vergible Woods is Tea Cake's real name. Tea Cake is a charming, fun-loving younger man who becomes Janie's third husband and the love of her life. He meets Janie in Eatonville after Joe Starks dies, and they eventually marry and move to the Everglades (the muck) to work as migrant farmers. His nickname 'Tea Cake' reflects his sweet, playful personality. Tragically, Tea Cake dies after being bitten by a rabid dog during the hurricane, and Janie is forced to shoot him in self-defense when he attacks her in his rabies-induced madness. The court rules his death 'entirely accidental and justifiable.'

Q: What specific circumstances led Vergible Woods to Janie?
A: Tea Cake (Vergible Woods) came to Janie's store due to a mix-up about a baseball game. He thought the game was being held at Hungerford, so he got a ride to where the road turns off from the Dixie Highway and walked to Eatonville, only to discover the game was actually in Winter Park. Since everyone in town had gone to the game and all the cars were gone, he couldn't get to Winter Park. Finding Janie alone in the store (Hezekiah had asked off to go to the game), he came in to buy cigarettes (Camels) and ended up staying to teach her how to play checkers, which began their relationship.

Q: In what specific ways was Tea Cake a different sort of man in contrast to Logan Killicks and Jody?
A: Tea Cake differed from Logan Killicks and Jody Starks in several fundamental ways. First, he treated Janie as an equal partner rather than as property or a symbol of status. Unlike Logan, who wanted Janie to work in the fields plowing and moving manure, and unlike Jody, who wanted her to 'sit wid folded hands' as a trophy wife of the mayor, Tea Cake engaged Janie in playful companionship. He taught her to play checkers (something Jody said was 'too heavy fuh mah brains'), went fishing with her at midnight, took her hunting, to movies, dances, and baseball games. When Tea Cake set up the checkerboard, 'she found herself glowing inside. Somebody wanted her to play. Somebody thought it natural for her to play.' This was revolutionary - neither previous husband had thought it natural for Janie to participate in leisure activities. Second, Tea Cake brought fun and spontaneity into her life. Going fishing after midnight made Janie feel 'like a child breaking rules,' experiencing joy and adventure for the first time. Third, Tea Cake showed genuine affection and intimacy - combing her hair, telling her she was beautiful, picking out colors for her to wear. As Janie explained to Pheoby: 'Ah always did want tuh git round uh whole heap, but Jody wouldn't 'low me tuh... Ah wants tuh utilize mahself all over.' Tea Cake allowed and encouraged her full self-expression, while Logan wanted a work mule and Jody wanted a silent ornament.

Q: How old was Tea Cake and how old was Janie when they first met?
A: Tea Cake was around twenty-five years old and Janie was around forty years old when they first met. This made Janie nearly twelve years older than Tea Cake.

Q: When Janie and Tea Cake first met, Tea Cake claims to have had a hard time sleeping. Why?
A: Tea Cake couldn't sleep because he had been wishing so badly to get his hands in Janie's hair. He was captivated by her beautiful hair and couldn't stop thinking about it, saying it felt like underneath a dove's wing next to his face.

Q: Why did Janie almost fall asleep while hanging on a newel post?
A: Janie almost fell asleep hanging over the newel post because she was deep in thought after Tea Cake's sudden departure following their emotionally charged conversation. Tea Cake had just confessed his feelings for her, saying he'd 'ruther be shot wid tacks' than have her treat him coldly. After he 'almost ran out of the door,' Janie stood at the newel post processing conflicting thoughts and emotions - initial joy ('lit up like a transfiguration'), then doubt (thinking he was just saying anything to make her believe him), then resignation about their age difference. She was so absorbed in thinking about Tea Cake and what his words meant that she nearly fell asleep standing there. Before going to bed, she examined herself in the mirror - her mouth, eyes, and hair - showing she was contemplating herself as a romantic object through Tea Cake's eyes.

Q: Why did Tea Cake make it a point to visit Janie very early in the morning when their relationship was just developing?
A: Tea Cake visited Janie early in the morning to prove that his feelings for her were genuine and not just romantic notions that came at night. By coming at daybreak, he wanted to show her his 'daytime thoughts' and 'daytime feelings,' demonstrating that his affection was sincere and constant, not something that faded in the clear light of day. This gesture addressed Janie's doubts about whether his intentions were real, as she had questioned whether his feelings were just 'night thoughts' that would disappear by morning. Tea Cake's early visit, bringing strawberries he had picked, was his way of proving his love was genuine and worthy of her trust.

Q: What did Janie and Tea Cake do at Winter Park?
A: Janie and Tea Cake attended the big Sunday School picnic together at Winter Park. Tea Cake worked for two weeks to earn money and borrowed a car so they could go shopping in Winter Park or Orlando for supplies for the occasion. Janie wore pink linen to the picnic. This public outing marked a significant turning point in their relationship, as it was after this picnic that the town began to notice and disapprove of their courtship.

Q: What rumors or accusations did the men of Eatonville make against Tea Cake when they first noticed he was spending time with Janie?
A: The men of Eatonville accused Tea Cake of being after Janie's money and planning to spend her wealth. They believed he was 'spendin' on her now in order tuh make her spend on him later' - essentially that he was using his charm and attention as an investment to eventually drain her inheritance from Joe Starks. Sam Watson told Pheoby that 'Tea Cake can't do nothin' but help her spend whut she got' and that he was 'Throwin' away whut Joe Starks worked hard tuh git tuhgether.' The Pastor accused Tea Cake of keeping Janie away from church so he could have the money she would have given in offering to 'buy gas wid.' The townspeople compared Janie's situation to that of Annie Tyler, an older widow who was swindled by a younger man named 'Who Flung' who took all her money and abandoned her. The men were also critical that Tea Cake had no money of his own ('he ain't got uh dime tuh cry') and was younger than Janie, making his motives suspicious.

Q: Janie says 'it would be a complete flommuck'. What does she mean by this?
A: By 'flommuck,' Janie means a complete failure, disaster, or mess. She is explaining to Pheoby why she is selling the store before marrying Tea Cake. Janie recognizes that Tea Cake is fundamentally different from her late husband Jody Starks - Tea Cake is not a businessman or someone who pursues property and status. If Tea Cake tried to run the store and be like Jody, it would be a total disaster because that is not who he is. Additionally, everyone in town would constantly compare Tea Cake unfavorably to Jody if they stayed. Instead, Janie plans to leave Eatonville and 'start all over in Tea Cake's way' because their relationship is 'uh love game' rather than 'a business proposition' or 'a race after property and titles.'

Q: Who was Annie Tyler and what happened to her? Why did Phoeby remind Janie about her?
A: Annie Tyler was a fifty-two-year-old widow from Eatonville who had been left with a good home and insurance money. She was known in the town for dyeing her hair, wearing uncomfortable false teeth and high-heeled slippers, and having love affairs with much younger men in their late teens and early twenties. She would spend her money on suits, shoes, and watches for these young men, who would leave her as soon as their wants were satisfied. When her ready cash ran out, a young man nicknamed 'Who Flung' came along, denounced her previous lover as a scoundrel, and moved in with her. He persuaded her to sell her house and go to Tampa with him. Once there, he took her to a shabby room in a shabby house, promised to marry her the next day, stayed with her for two days, and then disappeared with all her money. Annie Tyler was left broken, humiliated, and destitute. She eventually made it back to Maitland on the train, looking aged and worn, with her pride completely gone. Her married daughter took her away to die in peace. The narrator observes poignantly: 'She had waited all her life for something, and it had killed her when it found her.' Phoeby reminded Janie about Annie Tyler as a warning because Janie was also an older widow with money who was planning to sell out and go off with a younger man (Tea Cake). Phoeby was concerned that Janie might suffer the same fate as Annie Tyler - being used for her money and then abandoned. However, Janie distinguished herself from Annie Tyler, saying 'Ah ain't Mis' Tyler and Tea Cake ain't no Who Flung.'

Q: Why did Tea Cake go to Jacksonville?
A: Tea Cake went to Jacksonville for two reasons: to get a job at the railroad shops where he had worked before (his old boss had promised him work), and to marry Janie. He had previously worked in the railroad shops there and his former boss promised him a job when the next pay day came. He wrote to Janie telling her to come to Jacksonville so he could marry her right from the train station.

Q: What reason does Tea Cake give Janie for stealing her $200? What did he spend the money on?
A: Tea Cake explains that he took the money out of curiosity while tying his tie and, upon discovering how much it was, he wanted to feel like a millionaire and let people know who he was. He had never had his hand on so much money before. He spent the $200 on throwing a lavish free chicken and macaroni supper for railroad workers in Callahan, complete with fried chicken, biscuits, and a washtub full of macaroni with cheese. He also hired a guitar player so people could dance, paid ugly women not to come in (including $5 to one particularly ugly woman), and bought himself a new guitar for $15. By the time the party ended, he had only $12 left.

Q: What is a 'boogerboo' and what did Tea Cake do to him/it?
A: A 'boogerboo' is a slang term used to describe a troublemaker or someone who is causing problems. In the novel, the term refers to a rude, aggressive man who showed up at Tea Cake's party and started causing trouble by trying to take all the best pieces of chicken (the livers and gizzards) for himself, refusing to let anyone else serve him. When nobody else could calm him down, Tea Cake confronted him and challenged him to a fight. Tea Cake knocked out two of the man's teeth, and the boogerboo left the party after that.

Q: What type of gambling was Tea Cake particularly fond of?
A: Tea Cake was particularly fond of dice (rolling dice), though he was also skilled at cards. He describes himself as 'one uh de best gamblers God ever made' who can handle 'Cards or dice either one,' but dice is emphasized throughout the text as his specialty, with him practicing dice all week and later being renowned for 'amazing things with anybody's dice.'

Q: How did Tea Cake wind up being cut by a man with a switch blade?
A: Tea Cake was cut while gambling on payday in Jacksonville. He won all the money in the dice game, including cleaning out a man called Double-Ugly. When Tea Cake tried to leave around 4 o'clock in the morning with his winnings, Double-Ugly accused him of switching the dice. As Tea Cake reached the door with his hat on and one arm in his coat, Double-Ugly jumped at him from behind and cut him twice in the back with a razor (not a switch blade). Tea Cake then grabbed Double-Ugly by his necktie and overpowered him, causing Double-Ugly to lose his razor while trying to get free. Tea Cake left Double-Ugly on the doorstep and made his way home to Janie. Notably, it was actually Double-Ugly who used a razor, while Tea Cake had bought a new switch-blade knife for protection before the game.

Q: During what time of year did Janie and Tea Cake travel down to the muck?
A: Janie and Tea Cake traveled to the muck (the Everglades) in September, arriving before the bean-picking season officially opened in late September. They came early to secure a room with a bath before the crowds of migrant workers arrived.

Q: What did they plan to do on the muck?
A: Tea Cake and Janie planned to pick beans during the day and at night Tea Cake would play his guitar (pick his box) and gamble by rolling dice. Tea Cake also planned to plant beans when the season opened, working for the best boss-man on the muck. The Everglades around Clewiston and Belle Glade was where they raised cane, string-beans, and tomatoes, and Tea Cake saw it as an opportunity to make money.

Q: Why did Tea Cake try to get to the muck 'early'?
A: Tea Cake wanted to arrive at the muck early for two main reasons: First, to secure a room at the hotel with a bath tub before the crowds arrived - since accommodations were extremely limited and would quickly fill up when the season opened. Second, and more importantly, to get a good picking job with the best boss-man before the other workers arrived. Tea Cake explains that while anyone can get jobs during the season, arriving early allows you to work with 'the right folks' - meaning the best employers who offer better working conditions.

Q: What special skills or hobbies did Tea Cake teach Janie for the first time in her life?
A: Tea Cake taught Janie several skills she had never learned before: how to play checkers, how to shoot (pistol, shotgun, and rifle), how to fish at night, and how to drive a car. Janie had been excluded from these activities during her marriage to Joe Starks, who believed such things were beneath her. Tea Cake not only taught her these skills but encouraged her participation, and Janie became so proficient at shooting that she eventually surpassed Tea Cake himself, able to shoot the head off a chicken-hawk in a pine tree.

Q: Why did Tea Cake encourage Janie to work with him in the fields?
A: Tea Cake encouraged Janie to work with him in the fields because he got lonesome without her during the workday. He had been leaving work to come home and see her at odd hours, losing work time. He wanted her with him so they could be together all day rather than being separated.

Q: Who was Nunkie and why was she chunky?
A: Nunkie was a young woman who worked in the bean fields on the muck in the Everglades alongside Janie and Tea Cake. She was described as 'a little chunky girl' who flirted aggressively with Tea Cake, trying to lure him away from Janie. She would playfully hit Tea Cake, contradict everything he said, and pretend to fall helplessly against him or onto the ground so he would have to pick her up. The word 'chunky' refers to her physical build - she was short and solidly built. Tea Cake later dismisses her as 'dat lil chunk of a woman,' reinforcing that she was small and stocky in stature compared to Janie. Nunkie's flirtation made Janie experience jealousy for the first time, ultimately leading to a confrontation when Janie found Tea Cake and Nunkie 'struggling' in the cane field.

Q: What kind of 'dances' did Janie and Tea Cake start to have or host in back of her house?
A: Janie and Tea Cake hosted 'fire dances' behind their house. These were Bahaman dances featuring drummers, which they began hosting after befriending the Bahaman workers (called 'Saws') in the Everglades. The dances were held night after night, and Tea Cake and Janie stayed up so late at these fire dances that Tea Cake would not let Janie go with him to the field so she could get her rest.

Q: Why did Mrs. Turner speak so disparagingly about Booker T. Washington?
A: Mrs. Turner spoke disparagingly about Booker T. Washington because of her deeply held colorist beliefs and worship of Caucasian characteristics. As a dark-skinned Black man, Washington represented the opposite of what she valued. She accused him of 'cutting the monkey for white folks' - meaning she believed he demeaned himself to gain white approval and was 'pomped up' by whites as a result. She also criticized his emphasis on work and manual labor, claiming 'He didn't do nothin' but hold us back—talkin' 'bout work when de race ain't never done nothin' else.' To Mrs. Turner, Washington was 'uh white folks' nigger' - an enemy to Black people because he didn't advance the cause of lighter-skinned, more 'white-featured' African Americans like herself. Her brother shared these views and reportedly 'tore him tuh pieces' in a paper at a Sunday School Convention.

Q: Why was Mrs. Turner especially attracted to Janie?
A: Mrs. Turner was especially attracted to Janie because of Janie's light skin and Caucasian features. Mrs. Turner worshipped whiteness and had 'built an altar to the unattainable—Caucasian characteristics for all.' She valued Janie's 'coffee-and-cream complexion' and 'luxurious hair' because these features set Janie apart from darker-skinned Black people. Mrs. Turner 'paid homage to Janie's Caucasian characteristics as such,' and being around Janie gave her 'a feeling of transmutation, as if she herself had become whiter and with straighter hair.' Mrs. Turner's colorism and internalized racism made her seek out Janie specifically because Janie's lighter features aligned with Mrs. Turner's worship of whiteness.

Q: According to the narrator, why did Mrs. Turner patiently endure mistreatment or cruelty from Janie?
A: Mrs. Turner endured mistreatment from Janie because she worshipped Janie's Caucasian characteristics (her light skin, coffee-and-cream complexion, and luxurious hair) as if Janie were a deity. The narrator explains that Mrs. Turner had built an altar to whiteness and Caucasian features, and like all worshippers, she accepted cruelty from her deity. According to the narrator's philosophy, 'All gods who receive homage are cruel' and worshippers inevitably accept inconsistency and cruelty from their gods. Because Janie looked 'more white folkish' than Mrs. Turner, it was 'right that they should be cruel to her at times' in Mrs. Turner's worldview.

Q: Why did Tea Cake feel it was necessary to whip and slap Janie?
A: Tea Cake beat Janie to assert his possession of her and to demonstrate his control to the Turners. When Mrs. Turner brought her brother to meet Janie, hoping to lure Janie away from Tea Cake, Tea Cake became jealous and fearful of losing her. He beat Janie not because she did anything wrong, but to relieve his own insecurity and to show Mrs. Turner and her brother that he was Janie's boss. As Tea Cake himself explains, he beat her 'tuh show dem Turners who is boss' after Mrs. Turner had been telling Janie that Tea Cake was 'too black' for her. The act was about reassuring himself of his possession of Janie and demonstrating dominance to those who were trying to interfere in their relationship.

Q: How did Tea Cake's friends react when they learned Tea Cake had beaten Janie?
A: Tea Cake's friends reacted with envy and admiration when they learned he had beaten Janie. Both men and women in the fields talked about it the next day, and it 'aroused a sort of envy' in them. Sop-de-Bottom told Tea Cake he was 'a lucky man' because you could see every place he hit her and Janie didn't fight back. Sop envied Tea Cake for having such a 'tender woman' and expressed that he wished he could whip a woman like Janie, complaining that his own wife would fight back all night and no one could even tell he had hit her. The women admired how Tea Cake pampered Janie afterward, as if the slaps had 'nearly killed her,' and the men admired Janie's helpless devotion to Tea Cake.

Q: What circumstances led to the brawl at Mrs. Turner's?
A: The brawl at Mrs. Turner's eating house was orchestrated by Tea Cake and his friends as retaliation against Mrs. Turner's colorism and her attempts to break up Tea Cake and Janie's marriage. Mrs. Turner, who worshipped 'Caucasian characteristics' and despised dark-skinned Black people, had sent for her lighter-skinned brother to 'bait Janie in and take her way' from Tea Cake. When Tea Cake learned of this scheme, he and Sop-de-Bottom and the other men decided to run Mrs. Turner off the muck. On Saturday night, after everyone got drunk on 'coon-dick,' Tea Cake and his friends gathered at Mrs. Turner's eating house. The staged fight began when Coodemay tried to take Sop-de-Bottom's chair. Sop resisted, coffee got spilled, and Sop threw a saucer at Coodemay but hit Bootyny instead. Bootyny threw a coffee cup back, and the fight escalated. Tea Cake pretended to restore order while actually making things worse, causing the destruction of Mrs. Turner's establishment with broken dishes, tables, chairs, and windows.

Q: How did Tea Cake react when the brawl broke out?
A: When the brawl broke out at Mrs. Turner's eating house, Tea Cake actively led and escalated the fight rather than trying to stop it. He grabbed Coodemay by the collar and insisted on throwing him out, claiming to defend Mrs. Turner's honor. Despite Mrs. Turner's pleas to leave the troublemakers alone, Tea Cake refused to stop, declaring he would show them they could not 'come runnin' over nice people.' He continued fighting until Coodemay finally admitted he was wrong. This was actually a calculated move - Tea Cake and his friends had secretly planned the brawl to wreck Mrs. Turner's restaurant and drive her out of business because she was 'color-struck' and had been trying to lure Janie away from Tea Cake with her lighter-skinned brother.

Q: What was Mrs. Turner's opinion of Tea Cake? Of Booker T. Washington?
A: Mrs. Turner disapproved of Tea Cake because he was too dark-skinned. She could not understand why a light-skinned woman like Janie would marry 'a man as dark as Tea Cake' and told Janie she 'jus' couldn't see mahself married to no black man.' She believed lighter-skinned Black people should 'class off' from darker ones and wanted to introduce Janie to her lighter-skinned brother as a replacement for Tea Cake. Regarding Booker T. Washington, Mrs. Turner held him in contempt, calling him 'a white folks' nigger' who 'didn't do nothin' but hold us back.' She said 'All he ever done was cut de monkey for white folks' and boasted that her brother 'read uh paper on Booker T. Washington and tore him tuh pieces' at a Sunday School Convention. Mrs. Turner's views reflect her internalized racism and worship of 'Caucasian characteristics.'

Q: Why did Mrs. Turner feel the way she did about Tea Cake?
A: Mrs. Turner disliked Tea Cake primarily because of his dark skin color. As a colorist who worshipped Caucasian physical characteristics, Mrs. Turner believed that lighter-skinned Black people should 'class off' from darker-skinned ones. She viewed Tea Cake's darkness as a defilement of Janie, whom she admired for her 'coffee-and-cream complexion' and 'luxurious hair.' Mrs. Turner had built 'an altar to the unattainable - Caucasian characteristics for all' and saw Tea Cake as a 'desecrator' of this ideal. She believed Janie had married beneath herself and actively tried to replace Tea Cake with her own lighter-skinned brother. Additionally, she resented Tea Cake for mocking her beliefs, as he once told her not to 'make God look so foolish - findin' fault wid everything He made.'

Q: Who or what was Big John de Conquer?
A: Big John de Conquer was a legendary African American folk hero celebrated in the oral storytelling traditions of the Muck workers. He was described as a larger-than-life figure, 'a man dat wuz more'n man,' who embodied strength, defiance, and supernatural abilities. According to the tales told by the 'flame-throwers' (storytellers), Big John de Conquer did everything big on earth, then went up to heaven without dying, played guitar for the angels around God's throne, won a flying race to Jericho against everyone except God and Old Peter, went down to hell, beat the devil, and passed out ice water to everyone there. He was also characterized as someone who 'wouldn't dig potatoes, and he wouldn't rake hay: He wouldn't take a whipping, and he wouldn't run away' - representing resistance to oppression and enslavement. The character represents the spirit of resilience and triumph in African American folklore.

Q: Explain the circumstances which led the narrator to say 'their eyes were watching God.' Whose eyes are intended?
A: The title phrase appears during the devastating 1928 Okeechobee hurricane in Chapter 18. Janie and Tea Cake, along with Motor Boat and other migrant workers, are trapped in their flimsy shanty as the hurricane intensifies. Earlier, Seminole Indians had passed through warning of the coming storm ('Saw-grass bloom. Hurricane coming'), but the workers ignored them because they were making good money picking beans. When the hurricane finally strikes with full force, the wind comes back 'with triple fury' and extinguishes the light for the last time. In the darkness, the people huddle together, helpless against the overwhelming power of nature. The narrator describes how 'their eyes straining against crude walls and their souls asking if He meant to measure their puny might against His.' At this moment of existential crisis, when humans face the terrible power of nature and their own mortality, 'they seemed to be staring at the dark, but their eyes were watching God.' The 'eyes' belong to Janie, Tea Cake, and all the other migrant workers sheltering in shanties across the muck during the storm. Earlier in the scene, the narrator mentions 'Six eyes were questioning God,' referring specifically to Janie, Tea Cake, and Motor Boat. The phrase captures the moment when people, stripped of all pretense and facing death, look beyond the physical darkness to confront the divine - questioning whether God intends to test their insignificant human strength against His omnipotent power.

Q: How did Tea Cake acquire hydrophobia?
A: Tea Cake acquired hydrophobia (rabies) when he was bitten by a rabid dog during the hurricane. While fleeing the rising floodwaters of Lake Okeechobee, Janie grabbed onto a swimming cow for support. A mad dog was riding on the cow's back and attacked Janie. Tea Cake dove into the water and fought the dog with his knife to save Janie. During the struggle, the dog bit Tea Cake high up on his cheekbone before Tea Cake killed it. The bite from the rabid dog infected Tea Cake with hydrophobia, which would later prove fatal.

Q: Why was Tea Cake accosted by a white man with a rifle? What did this man force him to do?
A: After the hurricane devastated the area, Tea Cake was accosted by two white men with rifles who were rounding up men to help bury the dead. There were so many corpses from the storm that authorities were pressing men into forced labor to clear the wreckage and bury bodies. When Tea Cake protested that he was a working man with money and had just been blown out of the Glades by the storm, the short man threatened him with his rifle, saying 'Don't look out somebody'll be buryin' you!' Tea Cake was forced to join a small army of men who had to search for bodies throughout the devastation - in wrecked houses, under houses, tangled in shrubbery, floating in water, and hanging in trees - and bury them. The scene also reveals the racial injustice of the time, as the guards ordered the workers to examine each body to determine if it was white or black, because white victims received pine coffins while black victims were simply covered with quickite and buried without ceremony.

Q: Explain how Tea Cake died.
A: Tea Cake died after being shot by Janie in self-defense. During the hurricane in Chapter 18, Tea Cake saved Janie from a rabid dog that was attacking her while she clung to a swimming cow. In the struggle, the mad dog bit Tea Cake on his cheek. Weeks later, Tea Cake began showing symptoms of rabies - he couldn't swallow water, became paranoid and delusional, and accused Janie of infidelity. The doctor confirmed it was rabies and that it was too late for treatment. In his final rabid madness in Chapter 19, Tea Cake threatened Janie with a pistol, believing she had betrayed him. Janie had prepared a rifle for protection and rotated the pistol's cylinder so it would click three times before firing. When Tea Cake leveled his pistol at her and pulled the trigger, Janie fired her rifle just as his pistol discharged. Her bullet struck his heart while his bullet missed, burying itself in the joist above her head. Tea Cake fell forward into her arms and bit her forearm before dying. Janie was tried for his murder the same day but was acquitted when the jury ruled his death 'entirely accidental and justifiable.'

Q: Describe how the Black community behaved during Janie's trial.
A: The Black community was hostile and united against Janie during her trial. They packed into the back of the courtroom, standing 'tight like a case of celery,' and were unanimous in their belief that Janie had wronged Tea Cake. They believed Tea Cake had been a devoted husband who worked hard for Janie and nearly died saving her in the storm, but that she had betrayed him by taking up with another man when he got sick. They wanted to testify against her and felt 'hanging was too good' for her. They 'pelted her with dirty thoughts' and had their 'tongues cocked and loaded' as their only weapon in the presence of white folks. They moved and talked together 'like a choir' in what Hurston calls a 'tongue storm' and a 'palm tree dance.' When Sop-de-Bottom tried to speak out against Janie, he was silenced by the prosecutor. After Janie was acquitted and the white women surrounded her protectively, the Black community 'with heads hung down, shuffled out and away.'

Q: Describe how the white community behaved during Janie's trial.
A: The white community behaved sympathetically toward Janie during her trial, ultimately acquitting her. Eight or ten well-dressed white women attended the trial, and Janie noted 'they didn't seem too mad.' During the proceedings, when Mr. Prescott silenced the hostile Black crowd who wanted to testify against Janie, the white women 'made a little applause.' After Janie testified and the all-white jury deliberated for only five minutes, they found that Tea Cake's death was 'entirely accidental and justifiable' with 'no blame' on Janie. Following the acquittal, the judge and others 'smiled with her and shook her hand,' while the white women 'cried and stood around her like a protecting wall.' This stood in stark contrast to the Black community, who had come to testify against Janie and 'shuffled out and away' with 'heads hung down' after the verdict. Janie then visited her 'kind white friends who had realized her feelings' to thank them. The novel also includes a cynical interpretation from Black men at a boarding house who suggest the white community's sympathy stemmed from racism: 'She didn't kill no white man, did she? Well, long as she don't shoot no white man she kin kill jus' as many niggers as she please.'

Q: What kind of funeral was held for Tea Cake?
A: Tea Cake had an elaborate, loving funeral in West Palm Beach. Janie spared no expense, having a strong vault built in the cemetery to keep him safe from storms. The Undertaker did a handsome job, and Tea Cake lay on a white silken couch surrounded by roses. Janie bought him a brand new guitar and placed it in his hands. Sop and Tea Cake's friends from the muck came with shame and apology, filling ten sedans that Janie had hired plus more. A band played, and Tea Cake 'rode like a Pharaoh to his tomb.' Unlike Joe Starks's funeral where Janie wore expensive black veils, she attended in her overalls, 'too busy feeling grief to dress like grief.'

Q: How did Janie respond to the cruelty from Sop de Bottom and Tea Cake's other friends?
A: Janie responded to the cruelty from Sop-de-Bottom and Tea Cake's other friends with understanding and forgiveness. Rather than holding a grudge against them for their hostile behavior during and after the trial, she recognized that their cruelty stemmed from their love for Tea Cake and their inability to understand what had happened. She chose to reach out to them, sending word to Sop and through him to all the others. Her gracious response brought them to the funeral with 'shame and apology in their faces,' and they wanted her forgiveness. They filled up the ten sedans she had hired for the funeral procession, demonstrating that her compassionate response had reconciled them.

Q: At the end of the novel, Janie tells Phoeby that there are two things that everybody has to learn for themselves. What are those two things?
A: The two things everybody has to learn for themselves are: (1) they have to go to God, and (2) they have to find out about living for themselves. This wisdom emphasizes that spiritual understanding and self-knowledge cannot be taught by others - not even by parents - but must be discovered through personal experience.

Q: At the end of the novel, what is Janie's attitude toward(s) the town gossips of Eatonville?
A: Janie displays compassionate indifference toward the town gossips. Rather than feeling anger or resentment, she pities them for their limited understanding of life. She calls them 'meatskins' who 'got tuh rattle tuh make out they's alive' and says they are 'parched up from not knowin' things.' She dismissively tells Pheoby to 'let 'em consolate theyselves wid talk' because 'talkin' don't amount tuh uh hill uh beans when yuh can't do nothin' else.' Janie has achieved inner peace through her life experiences, having 'been tuh de horizon and back,' and no longer needs the validation or approval of the gossips. She views their talk as meaningless because they haven't truly lived - 'you got tuh go there tuh know there.'
